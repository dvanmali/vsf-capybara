		"reviewText" : "The latest version of this camera does a lot of things right that previous versions failed at.First of all, the 720p video quality - both at night with the auto-enabled IR and during the day - is clear and sharp. Moreso, the wide-angle lens has a great field of vision.The software - on iOS - is fine. It's just not great. There isn't a lot you can do and - one of the biggest issues I have with the camera itself - there is no rotation like FoSCam and many other cameras feature.I will say, if you are a WeMo household, like we are, the software automatically recognized the camera and lets you do a number of cool things, including triggering any other WeMo operations with motion. It's well done, nicely integrated - but unfortunately the WeMo software operates completely separate from the camera software itself - clearly, this needs better integration (WeMo can create a rule, but to 'watch' the camera, the app opens the other app, and you have to manually switch back). It works, but its not elegant.The audio - both in and out - is fine, and about the same as comparable cams out there. Not great, but it works.Of course, recording offsite is an additional fee, but so is the case with competitors.Bottomline, there isn't much NOT to like about the camera; if only the software was a bit better integrated with WeMo, and the native cam software was a little more elegant. I really miss a motor for rotation, but otherwise, it's a great little camera. Not enough to differentiate from competitors products however, unless you do utilize WeMo in your house already.Setup was easy once - and it took several tries - the wireless signal from the cam was found.",

When its crowd outside, or even with some background noise, or anything like this you have to crank it and then it starts to distort as it&#8217;s only a single speaker and not a full 2-speaker stereo system.  The sound fades fast outside.The buttons are firm, so you have to press hard and hold it each time.  I tried over and over to pair to Dell XPS 8700.  It would never pair.  Vendor support?  Could not find much of anything, no website not even a simple URL, email or anything.  So I had no one to reach out too, to find out why.  Maybe it&#8217;s a OEM or something, but long term is a buy and throw away item.  It you have a basic cell and want sound its good, don&#8217;t expect the world, but it is way better than the cell speaker for sure.

		"reviewText" : "This review is for the HEOS 3.  This speaker has excellent sound, specifically bass, which is hard to find at times.  You can store the speaker horizontal or vertical, which makes it versatile for any location.  As long as you have a nearby plug in, this speaker is small enough to fit easily in many locations.  It is supposed to be for a small room, but it works well for medium sized rooms as well.Set up was easy, once I changed out my router.  I have an old router that has issues, and my set up wasn't going well.  I pulled out a newer router, and used the enclosed ethernet cable.  Once I did this, the setup process just flew through.  I have an Iphone 5s and a Netgear router.The only thing I don't like about this speaker is that I wish it was bluetooth.  It isn't, and it doesn't claim to be, but it would be nice because then you would be able to play other apps on your speaker.  I use aSony SRSBTX500 Portable NFC Bluetooth Wireless Premium Speaker Systemto play my Sirius radio app, and I love it.  With the Denon speaker, you can only play the apps that come on the HEOS app.  You have Pandora, Tunein, Rhapsody, Spotify and the music that you have loaded to your phone.  In order to be able to use Pandora, for example, you must have that app also downloaded on your phone.  Those are great selections, and some of the best music apps available, but it would be nice to have Amazon Prime music and Sirius available to play.The sound quality of this speaker is awesome!  It plays music on Pandora with such clarity, and the bass is super.  I live in an apartment, so I had to keep the sound turned at a decent volume, which turned out to be about 1/4 of the volume that it is capable of achieving.  The Tune-In app that allows you to play radio, doesn't come in as impressive as Pandora.It will be nice to have several set up, and see how they all work together.  I would recommend it, if you are looking for a home system that spans through several rooms.  Perhaps, Denon will add a few more apps in the future.",

Noise isolation is very good. Can't hear my kids yelling and the dog barking.3. Quality of sound is very good. Bass is good.5. Charge lasts at least 4 hours from my testing. They will last longer but I have not tested beyond that. They recharge in about an hour or so. Standard USB connector for charging is good. So I can use other cables if need be.4. Fit works very well after getting used to putting them on. They do not fall off during jogging or other high motion exercises.6. BT connects automatically after first setup. My other BT headphones do not and it's an extra painful step that these allow me to skip.Cons:1. Fit gets to be uncomfortable after longer uses. This is acceptable, as these need to be secure in your ear so they don't fall out while moving around or exercising. I would not recommend if you will be using for longer periods of time, as comfort will probably be an issue. Not as much a Con on the product but the type of headphone.2. Profile could be a bit smaller. They sick out a bit far but not any more than other BT headphones I've seen. I would have liked to wear these under my motorcycle helmet but they stick out too far.",

		"reviewText" : "I've been through several WiFi cameras lately, and the Belkin has certainly proven to be one of the better options. Image quality is good, and the camera itself is small, stable and unobtrusive.Out of the box, it's easy to setup - you can be up and running in just a few minutes if you follow the instructions closely. It's small enough that you can mount it anywhere, and the swiveling base gives you a lot of freedom in positioning. It communicates over your WiFi network - be sure you have good signal strength in the area you want to monitor - and like a lot of these devices, the connection flows out from the device to a manufacturer's website...although you might legitimately be concerned about privacy on the Belkin site, this means you don't need to open firewall ports. In my opinion, this is a better bet from a security point of view.Image quality is perhaps slightly above average for this type of product. You can argue that 720p is hi-def, but to me, the limiting factor is the degree of compression applied to the signal. A reasonable home-grade 720p camcorder, for example, would record at something around 10-12 megabits per second, but the Belkin is only a small fraction of this - and that's where the image quality suffers. True, most people wouldn't want 10-12 megabits of their Internet bandwidth consumed by a camera, so there are valid tradeoffs to be made - but don't expect DVD quality images just because it's labeled &#34;HD&#34;. Still, if your goal is to monitor on a smartphone, then you probably don't need any more than what the Belkin delivers.Speaking of remote viewing, the Belkin iOS app is okay, though a bit rough in spots. Still, it's pretty much everything you need to look in on your camera, and unlike some manufacturers, it's totally free to use. That is, unless you sign up for Cloud video storage - essentially a DVR in the cloud.I couldn't get the Belkin to work reliably with my home automation system (Micasa Verde Vera 3). There is a plug-in for Belkin WeMo devices, but it didn't seem to be able to discover the camera, and even when I configured it by hand, it never worked.Bottom line is that if you want a basic, inexpensive video monitor that's simple to setup and low cost, the Belkin is worth a look.",

		"reviewText" : "I've been a long time Creative customer since back in the Sound Blaster sound card days.  I've tried out a lot of wireless Bluetooth speakers and this one is near the best. And it's the cheapest out of all the best that I've tried. And the features are in abundance and it really shows that Creative knows how to do things right. It's just a really nice design with a lot of features that are super useful.The one feature I love and stands out is something I've never seen before, being able to record phone calls. I'm somebody who often wants to record a phone call especially when I'm calling customer service with a problem or complaint. A: because part of me wants to have a record of what we talked about for my own review. B: part of me was uploaded to YouTube if they treat me like a piece of trash. But I've never seen this option on a Bluetooth speaker before and it's just such a great thing to have. And records to your microSD card so that you can remove it and import it into your computer. It simply does the really shows creative put a lot of thought into how we might want to use the speaker.Another feature I find compelling and again a very unique feature for wireless speakers, multiple devices at once. With low-end speakers it's really annoying to have to keep pairing your device when you want to take over command. Special my friends are over and were sharing tunes. What's nice about the Sound Blaster Roar is that you can have more than one user paired at the same time to the speaker. Again another thing that shows Creative with the real thought into what the users want.The sound of the Roar is spectacular maybe not as good as the Bose speaker system I've used before but still pretty good by comparison. Definitely a great speaker you want to take it to a party/cookout/beach. It really does put out a lot of sound for a small portable device. It's rather impressive to see what Creative has crammed into such a small device.  A feature I did not get to try out is being able to run two speakers at the same time. To me you want to have sound usually spread across the room and running two speakers in parallel definitely will help saturate the area.What is NFC? Near field communication (NFC) is a set of standards for smartphones and similar devices to establish radio communication with each other by touching them together or bringing them into proximity, usually no more than a few inches.  I don't have NFC on any of my devices so I couldn't test it but I can't wait to get one because pairing via Bluetooth can be a pain in the butt. I'll test it out hopefully when the new iPhone emerges in the fall. But if it works as described as I'm imagining it does I can see myself using it all the time.So in conclusion I love this speaker. And it under $150 at the time of writing this review I think it stacks up against more expensive units by Sony and Boise and it has features that many of them lack. And this is perfect for cookouts with friends or trips to the beach really any time you want to have access to some musical entertainment.Thanks for reading!PS I really think a standout feature of this is the ability to record phone conversations.  This is something I wanted to do for so long and this provides an easy way to get it done.",

There does seem to be an issue with the unit's bonding, so where the top and bottom of the unit come together it is loose on one side. I would also be cautious with the cover for the storage area - bend it too far back and it would break.

It is pretty clearly aimed at those who want a modest, budget enhancement for gaming, whereas I am a music fan.  The speaker set basically exists for the primary purpose of having a small, unobtrusive subwoofer.  However, the main speakers are not exactly audiophile equipment, so what you really get with this set is the ability to crank up the bass a bit so that there is a modest rumble with those explosions in games.  For music, the sound is only a modest improvement on the built-in speakers on my iMac desktop.  Frankly, I have no desire to crank up the bass while listening to Miles Davis, so without good treble, these speakers are not for me.  The other limiting factor to keep in mind is that the cables are rather short, meaning you won't have many options for speaker placement.  They are just long enough to keep the subwoofer at your feet underneath the desk with the main speakers to either side of your monitor.  For music, speaker placement matters far more, so you need to have longer cables.Is this for you?  That depends.  If you want a good listening experience for music, sorry, but you'll have to shell out more money.  If you just want a cheap set with a subwoofer for those games, then I suppose these might do, but don't expect miracles.",

Obviously the louder you get the more harsh it sounds, though not necessarily distorted.  Being only 1 speaker you don't get the stereo effect of a Jambox or one of its asssociated copycats.  I find generally sound on those is superior, as well as the volume.  But of course they are more bulky.The utterly ridiculous voice that screams \"Waiting for Bluetoos co-nection\" (not a typo) is so annoying.  It is loud, it is obviously spoken (poorly) by a non-English speaker.  It seems this is common on these cheaper made in China speakers.  I truly fail to see how this is better than just a beep, an LED, or nothing at all.  It is just annoying.  I would probably give it an extra star if I could turn that off.-----------------------------------------------UPDATE - 7/9/14:The manufacturer reached out and said they were fixing my complaint about the voice prompt and would send me a replacement unit. True to my original review, I said that would add a star, and therefore I have revised my rating to 4 stars to do so.

I plugged it in, followed the installation instructions and let the genie update the firmware.  My brand new network was clearly visible on all of my devices, but nothing would connect to it.  I finally got the laptop connected, but the connection dropped mysteriously a few minutes later.  The router's power button was blinking, which according to the manual means a problem with the firmware.  So I backed off and manually re-installed the original firmware from their website.  The light was still blinking. I say all of this to make it clear that I am not a newbie.  I know what I am doing.I spent 30 minutes on hold at the Netgear tech support number, which suggests I am not the only one having trouble.  Sadly, after that 30 minute wait, the phone call was terminated with no warning, just BLIP and they hung up on me.  Kind of like the router's network connections.

The resolution is good at 720p, 1080p would be better but there are tradeoffs to make. As it is the 720p is good enough for my use. The best plus of this is the ease of accessing and viewing the video from an iPhone. It's never been easy with my Foscam and the third party apps are just not that good from what I've tried.

First thing you do to connect is to plug this thing to a USB power source, it could be your PC, a wall AC adapter, car adapter or a portable battery pack.  It will start broadcast signal so go to your device's setting and go to WiFi. You will see it as SABRENT_a340.  The good thing is that it pops up immediately unlike Bluetooth that you wait for a few seconds before you can see it, sometimes you wonder if it is working or not.  One last thing is to press Airplay and connect to SABRENT_a340. You can then connect a 3.5mm cable to play it through a speaker or straight to your earphone/headphones.  It would be nice if a 3.5mm cable is included in the box but it is not so you have to provide your own.Pros:- It doubles the range of Bluetooth.  I can play music 50-60 feet away from the receiver.- Built-in USB cableCons:- It doesn't have a built-in internal battery so you can use it without the need of being constantly plugged to a power source.  I have Bluetooth receivers that are smaller than can run for hours from its internal battery.- You cannot browse the internet while connected paired to the receiver.- You cannot play iTunes radio or any music stored in the cloud- Thin audio.

(I liked this a lot, my other ones seems to lack it)I brought it along for a trip and it helps a lot as there is never enough USB ports and especially USB 3.0.I used it with my hard drives/flash drives/some external batteries. Works without a hitch.It also worked well with my USB fan. Hot summer= I'm happy it is next to me. I usually run out of USB ports before I can plug in the fan...Transferring movies/shows/work stuff have always took forever, now it moves quickly and freeing my time up for other fun tasks.Overall, I recommend it as it should have all the extra ports you could possibly need.Hope this is helpful to ya!",

I am using the hub on an iMac, and the hub fits right into the overall look on my desk. The aluminum color of the hub almost 100% matches the color of the Mac and the keyboard.Other than that, there is not much more to say. Love the illuminated blue LED once the hub is connected to the computer, and the rubber \"feet\" make it stay pretty stable on my desk. As with other products from Aukey, there is also great attention paid to the packaging.If you don't need an active USB port (with its own power connection), then I would definitely recommend this passive hub.Disclaimer: I have been provided with a review unit for the product in order to share a fair and honest review.",

		"reviewText" : "It boots fairly quick. (I like the sound when it finishes booting up). You will need a male to male 3.5 mm cable or adapter. I had one so no problem but keep that in mind.Pros:- Audio sounds great- Less cables in the car- Very easy to hideCons- As with any Wifi audio streaming device, the audio does cut off but I noticed it happens VERY RARELY, and usually only when moving the phone around. If the phone stays put, then everything is fine. Probably the buffer being empty. (This is driving)- There is a lag of about a second in the audio. So if you are listening to Apple / Google maps, your directions will be a second later, but usually 1 second doesn't make much of a difference.- I wish the name of the Wifi could be modified. (More of a wish than a con)Bottom-line:If you don't like bluetooth quality then get this. (Make sure you have a device that works with AirPlay though).",

		"reviewText" : "Denon's entry into wireless home multi-room speakers is a force to be reckoned with. My only gripe is that it does not have blue tooth. I would love to use these speakers for our home theater and see how they stack up when watching movies. The only way to do that for now is to use the 3.5 mm cable input and connect it to your systems audio out jack. You can only play music from these speakers through the HEOS app, which tracks your habits. I hope that is a weakness they will fix in the future.My environment: 1800 square foot ranch style home with AT&T; u-verse Elite internet and their generic wireless router.SET UPThe HEOS 3 comes beautifully packaged with the power cable, 3.5 mm audio cable, ethernet cable, and quick start guide. The quick start guide is all you need, because set up is as easy as they make it sound. I downloaded the app, updated the software, and plugged the 3.5 audio cable into my iphone 4s and the speaker. The speaker connected and I labeled it on the phone.THE APPThe included app is ready to play Spotify, Pandora, Tunein, rhapsody, the music on your iphone, and local radio stations.There are three menu options: Rooms (you label each speaker on the app for a different space in your home), music (pick your music), and now playing. You can also turn music sharing on.You can easily swap between any of the speakers and adjust what they are playing along with the volume from anywhere in the house from the app.ADJUSTMENTSThe app allows you to adjust the treble & bass for each speaker. That is about all that is included.THE EXPERIENCEBoth the HEOS 3 & HEOS 5 are loud enough to fill any room in our house, including a very large finished basement. The HEOS 5 has noticeably deeper and fuller sound. It is crystal clear, which surprised me coming through wireless channels. I do not own a Sonos system, but I have played around with them in the store and I prefer the HEOS 5 to the Sonos Play:5. It's a toss up between the HEOS 3 & Sonos Play:3. I prefer my Bose Soundlink II to both 3 models, and the Soundlink is the entry model for Bose.The HEOS 5 is the real winner here. I would put 3's in your bathrooms, workrooms, and kitchen but would not use it as a main speaker for a larger room. The 5 belongs in the living room or den.BUFFER ISSUES: Some other users reported problems with the speakers cutting out. With my Internet set up I have not had that problem unless more than one other bandwidth intensive program, like Netflix is running. If our kids are watching Netflix while my wife is watching it in another room, the sound will break up once in a while.SYNC ISSUES: When playing the same speaker source all of the HEOS speakers play the music perfectly in sync. There is no lag that we have experienced in between any of them.I am happy with the HEOS 3, but am blown away by the HEOS 5. As good as it is, I will have to get my hands on the 7 now.",

The monitor can be VESA mounted and the included stand is pretty good.  It supports full UltraHD/4k at 60hz as a single tile.Then the bad:Many people including myself have experienced issues with DP 1.2 at 60hz.  There appears to be some kind of compatibility problem which causes a poor connection between the display and the graphics card.  This issue seems to mostly affect AMD cards but there have been some reports with nvidia cards. This results in display corruption, loss of signal, strange noises, etc.  The issue can be mitigated to some extent by using a higher quality and/or shorter displayport cable than the one included.For that reason, I would advise not purchasing this display until this issue is understood and resolved, especially if you have an AMD graphics card.

		"reviewText" : "This is wall charger will charge all devices at once, need I say more!There are four USB ports that are used for charging an array of devices from tablets to Bluetooth headsets or whatever else needs a charge. In the hand, it has a nice solid feel. The body is plastic, which keeps the weight light but strong. The finish is matte that enhances the grip while in the hand. Also, the AC prongs can be removed, which makes it perfect for traveling inside your luggage. On a side note, you can use a laptop adapter cord to plug it into the wall, thus giving you more working room.This charger plugs directly into the wall, which might be a hang up for some. I do not see this as problem since I am able to charge all my devices at the same time in one location. Before this charger, I would have to charge devices all over the house, now those dreadful memories are a thing of the past.Before use, be sure to read the back of the charger and see what port you need for the device you are needing to charge. You can charge up to four devices at the same time, but the maximum overall output will limited to 6.8A. This can be seen as a gift or curse, to me it is a gift. Being able to charge a diverse group of devices is a great thing.I use this single charger on my Galaxy Tab 2 10.1, Galaxy Note 2, and Bluetooth headset and speaker all at the same time. Now all of my devices are all in one place being charged, which is much easier.This is a must have charger if you have multiple mobile devices!FEATURES:4 USB Output Ports: 5V/2A (2x), 5V/1A (2x), (Max Of 6.8A When All Ports Used)I was supplied a sample for the purpose of review.",

		"reviewText" : "For my setup I got the HEOS 3 and HEOS 5.  I got the HEOS 3 first and tried it out by itself, the app was easy to install on my iPhone 5.  Setup was super easy, I really like the use of the 3.5mm cable to set it up from the phone, that is pretty smart!  This made setup and connection to my WiFi super easy.  After that the app allows you to control the speaker.The app works really well, but still needs some work (especially with applying updates), I kept getting update is complete and than constantly getting update needed messages, until it finally downloaded, until this update was applied to both units I could not group them together.  I will add that I do not love that I have to login to my music accounts through the app.  I think some form of interception of the native music player controls in iOS wold have been the best route, instead of routing the music stream through your web service, since I really do not like giving you my logins.  For now, this works, and maybe in the future a better mechanism for streaming with native apps might be introduced.  The app is also a little confusing with the layout, this is not an issue, but it was just an odd layout, maybe a better workflow could improve user experience, and make getting to speaker settings and other items easier.The speaker performed well, however, this smaller one (the HEOS 3) had a hard time with heavier bass and at higher volumes heavy bass was not understandable (to much rattle).  I tried adjusting the bass/treble in the app, but it really did not seem to change anything (maybe a bug?).  The trouble with bass in the HEOS 3 would knock it down a star, but the system as a whole and great sound from the HEOS 5 gives it 5 stars.  It would be nice if it could handle better sound quality even with heavier bass items.  The HEOS 5 did not have an issue with heavier bass.The HEOS 5 was just as easy to setup and use as the HEOS 3.  The HEOS5 had great sound and could handle bass and other heavy peaks better than the HEOS 3.  For a richer sound I would go for the HEOS 5.When I got the HEOS 5 I tried different settings and played with what all they could do.  This is a pretty cool system.I was able to easily identify where in the house each speaker was (you can set a name) and could easily drag them into groups to get the same audio playing on both of them or could have each one playing its own feed.  The audio was in sync between the two speakers which is usually the biggest issue when setting up multi speakers, I could not hear any lapse or delay on either speaker, they were perfectly synced!A cool feature was that I could plug in a 3.5mm in the aux on one speaker and pair both speakers together and have both speakers playing the aux input off of the one speaker.The app was easy to use, and in the future it would be nice for a computer application that could allow the same functionality so I could use these off a server or laptop without keeping my phone connected (if this is possible through a web service I did not see it; but this product is still new, so it could be something in the future).In the end I am really happy with this.  It was super easy to use and the audio quality was pretty good for a speaker this size.  The speaker is easy to setup and was super easy to use.  The HEOS 3 did not have as great of support for louder bass heavy audio, but the HEOS 5 did.  For a great wireless speaker setup with multi speaker support this is a great choice!",

		"reviewText" : "This is an interesting device in that it is like a Bluetooth receiver for playing audio but instead it uses WiFi and DLNA and AirPlay.You power it via a USB power source (like a power bank, PC USB port, or USB charger) and it creates a wireless WiFi network that you then connect your device to. You can then send audio to it through DLNA or AirPlay. It's quite small and lightweight, and has no built-in rechargeable battery. The USB power cable on the device is only a little over 3 inches and when not plugged into power the cable can be kept plugged into a port on the receiver itself, which is handy for storage and when it's not in use.The big \"pro\" is that the quality is better because it is not compressed like Bluetooth. It sounds great with my Sony professional headphones (the same jack that you plug the headphones into is also a 3.5mm line out jack). The downside is that it's a bit more hassle to disconnect from your normal WiFi network and connect to the device's WiFi network (which took awhile to show up on my iPad mini)... and when you do this you'll lose your WiFi Internet connection (but see the UPDATE below) so you won't be able to stream from the Internet if you rely on WiFi to do so.So it does what it says and quality is impressive and so is the size and portability of the device. If the WiFi connection method works well for you then I think you will be quite happy with the device. If you don't need the best sound quality then you may be better off with a simpler Bluetooth receiver (I would recommend one with aptX).By the way, there are two small LEDs on the device - a blue one labeled \"Audio\" and a red one labeled \"WiFi\".UPDATE 2014-07-09: I found out that you can connect this device to the Internet by connecting to its own WiFi network and then using a browser to go to the IP address on the bottom of the unit (mine was 192.168.168.1) and connecting to a wireless network. When you then connect to the Sabrent's WiFi network you will have Internet access. Unfortunately AirPlay doesn't seem to work on Internet connected WiFi network - you still have to connect to the Sabrent's own WiFi network... but the receiver does remember the network if you unplug it then plug it back in.NOTE: I was sent a free product sample for review.",

That took up all 3 of my USB ports and left no room for my external portable USB speaker. And my Surface Pro only has one USB port! That's why I was delighted to have the opportunity to review this slim, bar-style USB hub.I was surprised to see just how slim and lightweight this hub is! That's a big plus when traveling with my Surface Pro because this will fit into my small carrying case. It plugs into a USB port and gives you three additional ports for a total of 4 ports from one. It doesn't need an external power supply and there are no drivers to install because it's plug and play. The drivers are installed the first time you plug it in.I plugged in 4 different USB devices and all ports worked perfectly however, I did get a message on my Kindle screen that it was plugged into a low power port and therefor wouldn't charge while in use and would charge slowly when not in use. Because the power from one USB port is divided into 4 ports, you should assume that it won't charge any device very quickly, but the devices can be used while plugged into this hub.Although this is USB 2.0 rather than the faster USB 3.0, it will still work in a USB 3.0 port - just not at USB 3.0 speeds.NOTE: Anyone with a computer will find this to be very handy and even though I was provided a sample of this hub for reviewing purposes, I liked it so much I just ordered 3 more for other family members.",

The port that is used to connect to the computer is on the left hand side while the ports at the top are used to connect peripherals. The bottom also has two non-skid rubber feet at the bottom which i really liked and made unit secure on my table and didn't move around when connecting a hard drive or other usb items.the 2ft usb 3.0 cable provided was plenty of cable but not too much so you don't have extra cable laying all over your workstation and unit itself uses its small size very well also. Package contents: Aukey 4-Port Hub, 2FT USB 3.0 Cable, Instruction Manual. Free lifetime technical support and 18 months warranty. the free technical  support was a nice added touch you dont get with alot of other retailers and one i liked to see. data transfer rates of up to 5Gbps, you'll be able to sync files and interact with your Mac or PC more efficiently than ever; backwards compatibility with USB 2.0 / 1.1. overall i loved the simple design and great looking unit and highly recommend this product.",

		"reviewText" : "I am conflicted writing this because right now, these exemplary earbuds aren't working for me.Not because they don't work, they are just not working for me.I have a Samsung Note 2 that pairing with was crazy easy (hold down the button until the light under the right earbud starts flashing intermittent blue and red and that's it!) The sound was super, terrific, handling everything from hiphop to Audible books. There were a few warning signs, I now realize, when the sound quality would dip horrendously low as I walked--yes, just walked, with the phone attached to my belt--almost as if line-of-sight between the phone and the earbuds were required. That's nonsensical, I thought. These things are supposed to be good for at least 30ft!I especially loved the earbuds in the gym (note: when you're squatting with a bar across your shoulders, move the wire to the front!) where freedom of movement was exquisite. The ear fit, secured with the included plastic fins, was secure and  held fast usually although I found it seemed easy for those little black fins to pop off the ear buds so be careful. With three bud sizes, and two sizes of fins, some combination ought to work for the most. In my case, my left ear required a small bud to fit properly while the right went the medium route. Whatever.I was never afraid of sweat, everything's positively encased with a black rubbery veneer and full charging took about an hour or so via the included USB cable. I would have liked a quick way of verifying how much charge there is left because the only warning I had of low power was when it unceremoniously cut off.And then my heart broke. I had to hold the Samsung phone almost to my ear in order for the earbuds to work otherwise the pop-pop sound of a lost Bluetooth connection sounded constantly. I restarted the phone, broke and reset the Bluetooth connection, nothing. To make sure it wasn't the Orcas causing the problem, I connected them to my Dell laptop and the sweetest, strongest sounds flowed through them. Same with my wife's Samsung S5, no problem.And so, they're now lying unused on my bedside table, the dream shattered. So, 0 stars for the Orca earbuds now, but 5 excellent stars for when they worked.(I reached out to Outdoor Technologies and was told to send an email for support. I did, and so far&#8212;2 days&#8212;no replies.)",

		"reviewText" : "I love Belkin products, so I expected a lot, but I find this camera quite disappointing, both on the hardware level and especially on the software level.The frame rate is wicked slow, is my main disappointment with the hardware.The software has many dimensions of frustration. I think if I'd tried it only on my iPhone, I might have been happy with things, but the web interface was totally wonky. On the iPhone you can create an account and be up and running quickly. On the web only (which I tried first), everything was uber confusing. For example, you can have a Belkin account/login, but that's not the same thing as having a Belkin/netcam login. The login page just kept refreshing in Firefox, with no way to proceed to anything. In Safari, I was still having a hard time getting anything to work before I moved over to creating an account and doing setup with the phone. (I don't like typing on the phone, so on my keyboard seemed a better option for me, but the interface just wasn't going to work... probably I lost a lot of patience for this when I was trying Firefox.)Once I had it setup on the phone, I got an error message in my Firefox window that &#34;If you are using Firefox 11.1 or newer, you may experience some unexpected issues. We suggest using a different browser or downgrading your flash.&#34; Um, what? I am using FIrefox 30. So, fine, forget Firefox... but I still could never actually see a picture with Safari, even though I did manage to login and select the camera.On the phone, it barfed out on me once (possibly due to my attempts to use browsers), and I had to reset the camera to get going again.Oh, and when I was getting going, it kept prompting me for firmware updates... I did the update and eventually realized that it was having me install the same update repeatedly.I do kinda like that one of the intended uses is to tell you when there's motion, and that part seems to work well. I turned the notifications on, and have been getting updates.So overall, my big disappointment here is with the software, which is something that Belkin can remedy. I will update the review and the stars if this turns into a product I'd actually like to use.",

The front grill is metal and the rest of the enclosure is plastic held together with star or torx headed screws. The speaker is a dark grey color with a rubbery orange band encircling the outer edge. It has a ruggedly handsome appearance.The orange portion houses four membrane covered water resistant buttons. There is a power button which needs to be depressed until the blue light on the front of the speaker appears and the disembodied voice announces \"waiting for Bluetooth connection, etc.\" and to turn off, held and depressed until the light goes off.Another button features a phone receiver icon and is used to operate a call hands free. The remaining two buttons are volume up and down.  On the side three ports are contained under a small waterproof flap -- a standard port for Resetting, micro USB for charging, and the port for a 3.5mm cable.Included with the speaker is a male to male 3.5 mm mini plug cable in case Bluetooth is not desired or is not an option. This cable provides a means of connecting a music playing device to the speaker. Also included is a USB-A to micro USB cable for charging.An attractive, but quite short braided wrist strap is part of the package, but the loop's circumference is only nine inches. It fit the female in the household but was too short for the male. There is a User Guide but the English translation, although an admirable effort is a bit murky.On a full charge the speaker will play for six hours and from a completely depleted state, it takes three to four hours to charge. A red light blinks while charging, becoming a steady glow when fully charged.Another handy feature is that the speaker is NFC (near field communications) capable which permits Bluetooth pairing by simply tapping the speaker with an NFC capable phone or music playing device. Given its splash and shock proof characteristics, this is a speaker that will tolerate some abuse. I played a variety of music through it and the sound is excellent.Speaker provided by Omaker.",

		"reviewText" : "Normally when I receive a review sample I can do a thorough evaluation and write a review within two days. This one took longer. The reason is that it took me a while to hear the differences in this model versus theBrainwavz S1 In Ear Headphones, which also impressed me (and I also own).After going through a pile of albums to try to understand what the product description meant by smoother bass I finally found an album that allowed me to hear it:Portrait In Jazz. When Scott LaFaro's bass came in on Autumn Leaves I started switching back and forth between this and the S1, and also hauled out some studio reference monitors. These phones are capable of going down in the 18Hz range for the low end, which is lower than most in ear monitors and phones that are usually in the 20Hz range at the low end. I am not sure my ears can discretely detect the differences between 18 and 20, but I was able to detect nuances that the lower end provided.These also go up a little higher than more phones, which are usually in the 20 KHz range, Again, I am not sure I can truly hear sounds at 24KHz, but there is a discernible difference. I tested that end of the frequency spectrum with a few Ahmad Jamal albums since he tended towards the right side of his pianos.One other thing that took me some getting accustomed to was the over-the-ear way of wearing these. I am use to in-ear or the old fashioned over-the-hear phones and I had to play around with these before I figured out how to place them in my ears perfectly. If you are use to over-the-ear you will probably not experience the learning curve that I did.A few other features that I have come to expect from this brand are here: extra tips of different sizes, a hard case (Brainwavz Hard Earphone Case) and a 1/4\" adapter. I love the flat, tangle-free cable that is tougher than it feels. And it has an adjuster like a chin strap on a cowboy hat that aids in keeping these firmly in place with the over-the-ear way of wearing them.This is definitely a five star set of phones (according to my way of grading, anyway), and one that I will not hesitate to recommend to fellow musicians. We tend to spend a great deal of time listening to music and these do an excellent job of reproducing it. My advice, though, is to take your time when you first get them because their true power is not immediately apparent. When you do start hearing the difference you will understand why I rated them so highly.",

The Sound Blaster Roar is at the top of the list for performance. While I do not consider myself an \"audiophile\" I do love music and listen to music often. One of the problems I have encountered with many of the other units is a significant lack of bass. The Sound Blaster Roar delivers in the bass department and did not disappoint. Additionally, many units have a distorted sound at higher volumes but I did not encounter that with the Roar.Aspects about the Creative Sound Blaster Roar that I like include:+ Stylish+ Excellent build quality and durability+ Very detailed and specific user documentation+ Battery provides up to 8 hours of music before it needs to be recharged+ Small and light enough to easily transport (Comes with a carry case)+ I have not experienced any connectivity problems+ Sound is superb to include bass, treble, low, mid, and hi ranges. The sound is also very clean and distinct with no distortion even at a high volume.+ Set up and connectivity to the Bluetooth was very quick and easy (less than 1 minute)+ Provides a large, deep, and rich sound in a multidirectional manner so that your music fills the room+ Provides a lot of functionality such as: MicroSD card slot for your music, microphone to record conversations, can charge your Smartphone, bedtime mode that gradually fades volume,and moreOverall Assessment:Sound is a very individualized experience and depending on your expectations, hearing, likes/dislikes, environmental factors, room size, etc. your experience with this unit may be different. For me, I find the Creative Sound Blaster Roar exceptional. Actually this unit performs exceptional at any price point. I have used other Bluetooth speakers in this price range that do not come close to the sound and functionality of this speaker. You may ask, \"Are there better speakers available?\" and the answer is yes but those units will be much more expensive and generally larger. I am confident when I state that you will not find a better speaker at this price. I will be using this unit on a daily basis. While you may not need all the functionality that the Sound Blaster Roar provides you will be more than happy based on the sound alone. Highly recommended.Item provided for review purposes.",

I got tired of having to constantly plug my phone into the stereo's aux input.

		"reviewText" : "Modern laptops are becoming more powerful all the time. More RAM and hard drive space along with faster CPUs make many of them true desktop replacement PCs, and there seems to be no end to the enhancements in sight.But not everyone needs the fastest, most powerful laptop on the block. If you just need a laptop that does a good job at surfing the Internet, checking email, watching Youtube videos and making simple edits to photos, a good budget model should serve you quite well.The Dell Inspiron i3531-1200BK is a 15.6 inch laptop that will do everything mentioned above, and more. While it won&#8217;t be setting any speed records, it&#8217;s plenty fast enough and powerful enough to do what the average Internet user needs for a budget laptop to do.It comes with an Intel Celeron N2830 CPU, 4GB of RAM (expandable to 8GB), a 500 GB hard drive, 802.11bgn Wi-Fi support and a built-in webcam. Another nice feature is a numeric keypad which is something of a rarity among budget laptops. Add in the average 6.5 hour battery life and you can see that this is a pretty capable machine for the money!Of course at just $250 there are bound to be a few tradeoffs to consider, and that&#8217;s certainly the case here. For example, there is no optical drive for installing software from disc, watching DVDs or listening to CDs. But few people do those things with laptops anymore anyway, and if you need to you can always plug in an inexpensive external USB optical drive.The video quality provided by this laptop isn&#8217;t the sharpest around, but most users will find it quite adequate for watching Internet videos and such.Overall, this is a good entry-level budget laptop. The price just can&#8217;t be beat, and unless you need a laptop for gaming or running resource-intensive software such as Adobe Photoshop, I think you&#8217;ll find it to be a very viable option for your basic Internet and general purpose computing needs.",

		"reviewText" : "This is no I7 laptop, let's just get that straight.  But, it makes a good second back up laptop for me.  I'm using it to write this review right now.  I ordered mine from dell, at the time it was cheaper than amazon, and dell had them in stock.  I did remove the hard drive and replaced it with an SSD I had laying around which helped speed it up considerably.  It is a bit laggy at times, but overall it is usable and better than I would have expected for this price range.Here are the pros as I see them:-The price, the price, the price-The weight is much lighter than my I7 high end laptop-Battery lasts 5-7.5 hours depending on use, many Windows laptops in this price range only last 3 hours so this is a huge advantage.-The battery is user replaceable, which you can't take for granted anymore in a laptop.  Press two buttons and it pops right out!-Many laptops recently make it very hard to get access to the RAM and Harddrive for upgrades.  Several dells require you to completely disassemble the entire laptop to get to the hard drive including removing the screen, motherboard, track pad etc.  Which is a huge pet peave of mine.  This laptop has an access panel on the bottom to access the RAM and HD which is great!-A large 15.6 inch screen for a great price-This CPU doesn't run hot at all and has decent performance for the price.-It runs so cool it doesn't even have a fan at all!-Keyboard has a number pad, many don't in this price range.-Keyboard feels nice and doesn't feel too cheap, we will see with time though how it holds up.-Trackpad works good, buttons are loud when clicked though.-Nice to have a Windows laptop for this price, I like chromebooks but I can't connect to my at home Samba server from a chromebook so I gravitate to Windows.Cons:-There are the obvious ones like no USB 3, no Bluetooth, no wired ethernet, no CD/DVD Drive.  But in this price range I'm ok with that.  I have an external USB CD/DVD that I used to install Office on it so that wasn't an issue for me.-Windows 8.1, is better than 8.0 but if you have never used it before there is a learning curve for sure compared to Windows 7/Vista-Not blazing fast but you can't expect that from any pc in this price range.-Case feels cheap, it creaks and groans when I pick it up by a corner.-The quality of the video is pretty low, but once again it is usable for watching youtube, netflix videos, etc.  Just is less sharp than my high end laptop and can be a tad laggy occasionally.Would I recommend this???  Depends on your needs.  If you are on a tight budget and are a light PC user who wants to use it just for basic web surfing, Word Processing, and light youtube/netflix watching this will work fine for most peopleIf you are a high end, heavy user, I'd only use this as a backup laptop.  I would not be happy with this as my primary laptop personally since I'm a very heavy user.If you are a gamer, you of course know enough to not even look at this laptop as an option.Upgrade possibilities:  If you know what you are doing upgrading the hard drive to an SSD will help it feel more useable.  Also, I have not done so yet, but my understanding is that you can upgrade this to 8GB of ram which could help too.  It only has one slot for ram so you will have to remove the stock 4gb and replace it with an 8GB.  Make sure to get the DDR3L (The L stands for low voltage).  You want the 1.35 volt not 1.5 it may work with the 1.5 but will run hotter and use more battery.  The laptop comes with 1333mhz ram, but I think 1600mhz will work and run faster.  Take this with a grain of salt as have not tried it yet, but I believe the following RAM will work, and this is the type I plan to try upgrading to someday.http://www.amazon.com/Kingston-Technology-1600MHz-PC3-12800-KVR16LS11/dp/B00CQ35HBQ/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid;=1402328644&sr;=8-2&keywords;=8GB+DDR3+1600MHz+sodimm+DDR3LUpdate 6/23/14: I did buy and install the 8gb of Ram above.  It works great, but it does down clock the ram to 1333mhz as the CPU won't handle 1600mhz speeds.  But, the 1600mhz 1.35v ram does work great in here.  It feels even snappier now.  Between the SSD I installed and the 8gb of ram this computer is very usable and fairly snappy for most tasks.  The only time I see the video and cpu lagging a bit is if I am on a webpage with heavy adobe flash usage on it.  But, right now I have two browsers open and about 30 browser tabs open with now slowdown.  I'm still quite happy with this laptop for the money.  It is just important to throttle your expectations, this can't be compared to an Intel I7 CPU $1000 laptop, but it is good for basic web browsing!",

It would be fine for background listening in a quiet environment, but if you want to listen to music loudly, which many people might, or if you are dealing with lots of background noise, then it's not even remotely adequate.-Does nothing for treble or bass. Everything sounds right around the middle, flattening out most music.-Lacks detail. You don't hear the quieter elements in music, and it does not pick up on individual parts.

		"reviewText" : "The overall functionality of this laptop is great.  Being able to flip it open and start typing like a normal laptop is very productive.  Once the work is done, flip the screen all the way back and browse the interweb with a flick of the finger.  It really is the best of both worlds.In the styling departiment it is just decent.  Besides the flip screen there are no innovative features.  The weight is just slightly heavier then I'd would like, but it won't kill your hand if you are using it as a tablet.  Their 'windows' button on the screen is kind of annoying cause it is right where I'd put my hand.  The silver finish seems to be prone to scratching, just a few weeks has produced several small scratches just sitting on my desk.  The hinge system seems robust so that will be good in the long run.  The rubber feet on the bottom are leaving marks on the back of the screen when flipped into tablet mode.For being a small laptop, it is still easy to type on.There does seem to be some software build issues straight out the box.  After the initial large burst of updates the laptop was running very slow.  Eventually it cleared, but I have noticed other instances of slow down.  It seems to have mostly cleared up after 3 weeks.The touchscreen works great.  It has great accuracy even around the edges.  I've used other tablets that seem to not be able to read touches around the edges, which is really annoying when you are trying to close a program.  It is pretty responsive but no where near as quick as an iPad.  To be fair, I haven't seen any Windows tablets match the speed and accuracy of an iPad.The mouse touchpad is another weak point.  It is at times too sensitive and then at other times not responsive.  I also had some instances where using the touchscreen and then using the touchpad somehow 'broke' the touchpad functionality.  I was not able to click or scroll using the touchpad, only could move the cursor.  Rebooting fixed the problem.Overall it is a good little laptop, I wouldn't use it for AAA games, but for doing a little work and a little play it packs a big punch.Side note, check out the Lenovo Yoga for a strong contender in this market.",

Everything worked great (e.g., Bluetooth pairing) but I made the mistake of setting this speaker up on its side rather than as illustrated. Oddly, it still worked great especially on a hardwood table. But it is designed to sit horizontally. You've been warned!Sound quality: This speaker has some of the best dynamics I've heard from almost ANY speaker, with the only thing in question being its volume. Yes, it can still get hugely loud, but don't expect to have dance hall booming bass, especially in large rooms. That's not a drawback, in my book, rather it's a description of most portable speakers' capabilities. The most comparable speaker I've used prior to the Sound Blaster Roar would be theSony SRSX5which is similarly priced, but with a lot less features. If the specific features of the Sound Blaster Roar aren't needed, you might want to look into the SRSX5. Both can boom, but don't expect to use either in a club setting.Features: More than you'll likely ever need, but enough to have a ton of fun with. Some of the early reviews mention things that are no longer available (e.g., the mode that generates random sounds to keep you awake). Some features work better than others (ask in the comments and I can go in depth on individual features). I really like the ability to use this as a boombox by inserting a micro-SD card with your personalized playlist. Like other units with this feature, you don't have a lot of control, mostly just skipping forward or backwards. But, just make different playlists for different chips and you have your updated version of the 70's era cassette tape boom boxes.The ability to record incoming cell calls is VERY cool if you have that need and have found how difficult it can be to record cell calls. Just insert a chip, and when an incoming call comes in press the record button and you're set (all legal issues for your state on recording conversations are on you). Recording voice from the built-in microphone is just as easy. The microphone picked up my voice easily, as well as ambient noise from the kitchen about 20 feet away.Super fun unit with lots of bells and whistles; sound (if you don't need huge volume) is top of the line. 5 out of 5 stars.Sample received for review.",

The dropcam is black also so it doesn't stand out as much as this white one (depending on your decor.Images are sharp and the image is better in low light conditions.

Neither this unit nor the Dropcam have real time duplexing for the microphone.  On the dropcam, you toggle on the mic and have to quickly turn it off to hear.  On this unit, the mic is only active as long as you are pushing.  I think this makes conversation much easier.I like to watch my dropcam on my computer rather than relying on my cell phone and its batteries.  I have a little window on the edge of my pc screen.  The Belkin only emphasizes use throught the cell phone.

This charger helps me ensure that I have a steady supply ready for each performance.While this charger will not simultaneously charge all of the batteries the KC-110 needs, it makes charging them in groups of four fast, sure and safe. The LED indicator is more convenient than you can imagine because I tend to multi-task and sometimes lose track of things. The older charger I was using had red and green lights, but no way for me to tell if I had at least sufficiently charged batteries I could grab if I were strapped for time. This one tells me just how charged up each battery is (in thirty-three percent increments).What I especially love and why I rated this five solid stars is the refresh feature. This charger will drain down a battery and recharge it, which actually prolongs the battery life. If you read the description and wondered what 'memory effect' is, that is the tendency of a battery to cause false readings. Some batteries will be at 100 percent, but display a different number (or display fully charged, but not be). The activation function on this charger will correct that.I tested all of the above features and they work as described. While the world may seem to be moving towards batteries that power phones, tablets and just about everything else, the AA and AAA rechargeable are still very much in use and it you are using them, this is definitely the charger to get.",

Some are wired. Some are wireless. I'm sure I'm missing other things there.Having been a network engineer well before the 802.11b spec was anything anyone cared about, I was really excited to see Netgear was building a multi-core router that could handle my devices *and* be smart enough to create a &#34;slow lane&#34;. I had been giving some lower-end Cisco gear some consideration, but for my consoles, UPnP was a deal breaker.

I don't know what kind of gear people are using that makes the build quality seem &#34;premium&#34; here, but Netgear's own switches are built way better than this router and at a tenth (yes, 1/10) of the price. I flipped out each antenna, plugged it in, and got to configuring...The initial configuration from my Windows 8 system wanted to poop router and NAS applications on my system. I took a look at the router app, and ended up firing up a browser. The admin page that came up was indistinguishable fromNetgear's N900 router, which I thought was a major disappointment. This is squarely marketed as an enthusiast's router, so I was expecting at least as much functionality as you'd get out of DD-WRT on a throwaway router. Not so with the R8000. The router quickly called home and asked for a firmware update (V1.0.0.74_1.0.31)Once I had it configured, I started moving wireless clients over. About halfway through, I noticed that a couple of devices saw two 5GHz SSID's instead of one. Later testing would show that the router wasn't forcing slow devices to flop over to their own network. If the device could see two SSIDs with the same name, they'd associate with whatever you chose on the device, instead of the router being &#34;smart&#34; and choosing what network to allow association with.Strike one.Later in the evening, I noticed my Macbook Pro stopped passing WAN traffic, but didn't have any trouble hitting LAN traffic. Rebooting the router resolved the problem. And rebooting the router resolved the problem again after four hours. And again...Strike two.My ultra-fast router *should* be pretty impressive when it comes to LAN traffic, right? I mean, my months-old MacBook Pro *should* be able to connect to the network with the fastest throughput, and it *should* be pretty fast to my NAS device, connected to the router via GigE. Well, not so much. The throughput I'm seeing is in the neighborhood of 70 megabits. Even at 30% overhead, I should be seeing almost ten times the throughput I'm getting.Strike three.I noticed that Netgear has recently released V1.0.0.90_1.0.39 firmware, which seems to have addressed the &#34;the WAN just stops working&#34; problem, but has made LAN throughput even worse.Sorry, Netgear. That just won't do. For what this costs, I can buy three routers and run three separate wireless networks for less money, with improved throughput, and improved range.",

To get them back quickly I've been using the Powerex Maha MH-C801D Eight Cell as my \"go to\" charger for years.  It's wasn't cheap but it works well.  This charger, the aLLreli, has some features I wish Maha had included.Firstly, this charger is a lot less expensive.  'nuff said there.Secondly, this charger has a brilliant display, both in terms of visibility and design.  When batteries are charging the display lights up in a pleasing blue. When it's done charging the display shuts off.  There's no guesswork about when it's done.  The Maha display is quite dim and it's nowhere near as easy to tell when the charging cycle has completed.  As an aside, neither charger completely shuts off.  Instead, they both drop into trickle charge mode, leaking a few mA into any batteries that are connected to ensure they stay charged.Thirdly, this charger will charge a dead battery... the Maha won't.  Again, 'nuff said.Lastly, this charger can be more convenient.  The AC plug is attached to the charge and folds into the unit when not in use.Both chargers have a \"Refresh\" mode.  (Maha calls it deep conditioning.)  They both do about the same thing, discharging your batteries completely before charging them.  That is something that was necessary for NiCad's.  Many people will argue that it can be harmful to NiMH batteries and the best advice is to use it sparingly, if at all.ALLreli sent this charger so I could provide you with a review.  My recommendation is that if you need a charger this is a good choice.  If you already have one, for the money this is a great backup (and occasionally required if you have a \"top of the line\" Maha).",

It's strong & light and works in a number of different ways... Laptop style, flat, back bend for video playback, or as a tablet. In case you were wondering, yes the keyboard is exposed on the back when in the tablet configuration, but the keys are disabled once the screen is flipped around, plus they're recessed so they aren't really in the way. The battery life has been very good I've gotten at least 6 hours of life if not more. The Windows 8.1 OS is reasonable for tablet use and the touchscreen works well with it. And while it doesn't come across as zippy, It loads fast enough that I don't get video lag or ever feel like I'm waiting on it either. It does seem to run faster when plugged in. So if you're doing anything intensive, it's not a bad idea to plug in.The only cons I can think of are the lack of dedicated F keys (they're shared with the number row), and I've had one small hiccup with the trackpad in Chrome (fixed with a reboot). Other than that it hasn't locked up or acted unexpectedly.Overall, if money is tight any you need the laptop for work/school but would like to occasionally flip it back and just consume content then this is a great deal.",

A single plug in charger, with 4 USB outputs - means you can charge up to 4 devices at one time from a single socket.It comes with a separate clip in US wall plug, or (if you already have one), you can plug in a figure of eight lead into the charger. Just clip in the plug adapter, plug it into the wall and off you go.Build quality appears good, and there's a blue light to indicate power. It comes with 4 USB sockets, with two each of 1.0 amp and 2.4 amp. Basically, you should charge a smartphone or kindle on the 1.0 amp sockets, and larger tablet computers on the 2.4 amp. It will take longer to charge from the lower power sockets, but it's safer for devices which need a lower power input.In conclusion, at this price, it's a great alternative to having four separate charge plugs, and small enough to pack for a holiday with the entire family.Disclosure: I was provided this by the manufacturer for an independent review, although it's a pleasure to review good quality items.Highly Recommended.",

		"reviewText" : "Well, more like a 4.5.  I wanted a router with a bit longer 5ghz range as I had a D6200 in back of my AT&T; uverse, and the 5ghz signal was iffy in my room like 35ft away from the router.  This R8000 seem to be the latest with all the bells and whistles.  They touted long range with 6 antennas.  The -.5 is for the antennas.  For 299 retail you'd expect a little more quality.  You pull the antennas up and they feel like they're just gonna break off, very flexy flimsy feeling, but no problems once they're in place.  Not sure if they are helping or not yet, haven't had time to adjust them, they will stay put at 45 degrees and 90.  The router itself has like a whole line of leds on top which I don't know what they all are for, but it's bright.  You can thankfully turn them off in the setup.  The setup is identical to any other netgear router, so it was easy.  You can keep the 2 - 5ghz signals separate with 2 different ssid's, or combine them which I did using one ssid.  I didn't see much difference either way as the netgear seemed to divide up the online devices between the two, so I just let netgear do it instead of me having to put in a new ssid for half my devices.  So setup, I was up in less then 30 minutes, since I had a netgear already.  I updated the firmware and seems pretty stable.  Well for the 2 days I had it so far, it's been rock steady.  All my devices are at the same IP's so I know it hasn't rebooted as one of my devices is on an access point with dhcp built in and that always changes when the router reboots.  So far it's been pretty good.  All my devices have the 5 wireless bars and connections excellent throughout my smaller house.  I was only getting 2 bars in my bedroom with the D6200, so it's a little better then 2x the D6200.  I haven't tested my tablet outside, but that will be the next test.  I will post any negatives I find as I work with this, but so far it's a straight forward design and tried and true setup interface that's pretty easy to setup.  If you have an RG3800 and need info on how,  post a msg, i'll try to explain it.  Oh and I was connecting at low 200's Mbps with an AC1200 adapter,  but now it's always 650Mbps and above in my room,  any closer and it always connects at the AC1200 speed which is 867Mbps.  And the rest you can get from specs online, basically on/off button, usb 2 and 3,  4 Ethernet gigabit ports, 1 wan.Update: So far had it about a week and it's been working great.  I have my security cams forwarded with upnp on with no problems now.  Everything is working as it should.  I was a linksys fan, but this is working great for me.  Oh and it does have guest access too, but i have mine all turned off, two SSID's is plenty enough.  will put a network hard drive on next, will report if i have any difficulties.",

The bass is pretty good, but I think it sounds better with mid range and high notes. Still, it&#8217;s much better and much bigger than you&#8217;d get from the phone alone.It&#8217;d be a great speaker for camping or any outdoor activities &#8212; especially those where you&#8217;d be worried about splashing and inclement weather. Ideal for the poolside or the beach or for hiking where it might rain. (It isn&#8217;t water proof. There&#8217;s a cover for the USB and 3.5mm audio inputs, but it wouldn&#8217;t protect them if you immersed it in the water. Also: the grid that covers the speaker will protect from the occasional splash or light rain but would certainly leak if it went under.)",

When I finally put them in my ears, I was not disappointed.  The sound on these is really outstanding.  The highs and lows are clear and full.  The bass is punchy without being overwhelming.  The sound is balanced and for me, any type of music I've listened to with these has been stellar.These come with a hard shell case, that I only use to store the extra tips.  The flat, heavily insulated wires don't seem to require any added protection and I can pretty much treat these like they're heavy duty, because they kind of are.  The wires don't tangle and I don't feel like I'm adding too much stress or causing the internal wires any damage.They come with small, medium and large tips along with a bi-flange set and a Tri-flange tip.

A fully functional windows 8.1 15.6&#34; laptop costing in the low $200s is mind blowing. Part of the $ savings derives from the lack of an optical drive or touch screen.There isn't much to say. I've had it for about 2 weeks, so I can't judge durability. The laptop is made from cheap plastic, but the screen is nice, the keyboard feels sturdy and comfortable, you have a full numeric keypad. The only negative is the trackpad, which is usable but not good. We prefer to use a mouse instead.We only use it for basics, like web browsing, Office, printing, sending email.

		"reviewText" : "The Smart Keyboard solves a handful of problems well enough that its shortcomings are acutely frustrating.The core of the system is the Harmony Hub. It blasts IR like any other Harmony remote, it pairs with Bluetooth devices such as a PC, a Playstation, or an AppleTV, and it comes with two USB receivers that receive keyboard and mouse signals for devices that support USB input devices.It connects to your Wifi network and syncs with a configuration profile associated with your account on myharmony.com, which you are required to create. The mobile app also syncs with this account, which happens to allow you to control the system from anywhere you have internet access.The mobile app is required to configure the system. It connects directly to the Hub to configure the Hub's wifi connection. Configuration then proceeds online. There is no desktop or web-based interface.The physical keyboard connects to the hub using a Logitech RF protocol.&#34;Hub&#34; describes it nicely. It takes commands from the network or the keyboard, and relays them to whatever device is in use, using whatever interface is best for communicating with that device. It does a good job at this, for the things it is capable of doing.A Smart Remote cannot be paired with the Hub together with a Smart Keyboard. One Hub, one controller. That obvious application is, for now, one of many opportunities open to this system.Setup was fine. A lot of work has gone into the Harmony way of doing things, and it shows. The mobile app is easy enough to use. The first-run wizard gets you to a working system.The wizard forces you to turn devices on and off throughout the process, so it isn't something you can do while actually watching TV. You'll have to set aside some time to do this. If you have a projection display, brace yourself for some jarring and unnecessarily-abusive power cycling on your lamp. And once you've got everything complete and are ready to watch something, everything will be shut off. You'll have to turn everything right back on again to use it. There's probably some good reason for all this.This system uses a variety of approaches to control a variety of tricky components, and the results are accordingly inconsistent. Adjustable delays and repeats are valuable, but adjusting them and testing the results involves a lot of tapping and a lot of waiting. If your device requires multi-step control sequences, Harmony can handle it, but customizing the delays on that device might clobber the hacks that come from the database, and you can't recreate the hacks yourself.Macros are available, but only as sequences of commands attached to keys. Sequences can be mapped only to selected transport, navigation, and F-keys. You can map a sequence to a soft key in an Activity screen, but you have to map the sequence first to a key. Sequence mappings vary by Activity, so you can't make a sequence available across all activities. The range of actions you can use in Sequences is limited to device commands. Sequences cannot send keystrokes or trackpad gestures.In the kit I received from Logitech, the USB receiver labeled &#34;1&#34; responds as receiver 2, and vice-versa. If the units are pre-paired at the factory, these were paired incorrectly. If they are secretly paired during the setup process, I may have screwed it up. Either way, this maddening flaw would have driven me to return the whole system if a forum user hadn't observed the same behavior and shared the findings, and if Logitech support had responded any more quickly about my RMA request. I would like to have sent it back anyway so that their systems would have counted the defect, but Logitech didn't care to be bothered, and by that point, neither really could I.I did, after all, get it working, and I do, in the end, enjoy using it. I like having one device to handle all my components, keyboard and trackpad included. The mobile app is nice. I think my family and my guests can figure it out. I wish I could connect more controllers to it, and I wish I had more control in software. It's very frustrating, because this hardware has everything it needs to do everything most modern living rooms need, if the software were more open and more flexible. Laughably out of the question are web hooks or a scripting language. I just want macros and keystrokes, and some way to tweak the device-specific magic spells. Instead, I have to be careful not to break them.With any luck, this has some forward momentum, and will continue to evolve and improve. This is a great start.",

		"reviewText" : "...all part of the package that comes with a premium-priced portable Bluetooth speaker.The market is crowded with portable Bluetooth speakers. Many will deliver acceptable sound for most users, and even ardent audiophiles understand the limitations of physics as personal portable music relies on both a lossy format (.mp3) additionally impacted by the compression of Bluetooth audio streaming, all delivered to a small piece of hardware. But if you want to part with a few more dollars and up your overall wireless portable music experience, the features and sound quality of this speaker go a long way towards justifying its position at the higher end of speakers working in the same domain.Starting with what matters most: the sound. The SR20 offers the best sound I've heard from a wireless speaker...period. Whether acoustic, amplified, orchestral...whatever, the dual amps inside this speaker (which are no doubt responsible for driving its weight to more than 4.5 pounds) provide clear separation of frequencies (one drives bass, the other drives mid and high range frequencies). The speaker also contains two pieces of enhancement technology. The questionably named \"Roar\" button increases both volume and spatial/presence effects in a pleasing way (and the the expense of battery life). Also available is  \"Terra Bass\" function, which provides specialized bass treatment at lower volume levels (old timers will remember \"loudness\" buttons on systems from the dark ages).Bluetooth pairing was effortless with both an Android phone and an iPod Nano. The SR20 will pair with two devices simultaneously. Pause the content on one, start the content on the other and it instantly switches programming sources.This speaker is a also a digital music player via a microSD card. While it did not like the default file system directly imported from my Windows machine, once I reloaded the files outside of directory structure, it immediately recognized and played them. If you have a microSD card, this device also doubles as a voice recorder (saving files to the card in .wav files) for both spoken voice and phone calls. If your phone is the source of your music, it automatically pauses music and you can take your call via the speaker (assuming you want to share).Additional features include a bedtime mode (auto shutoff after 15 or 30 minutes) and an \"alert\" function that will intermittently increase the sound level, presumably to keep you from nodding off at your desk. It also has what might be the oddest function ever...a built in siren.Creative deserves extra credit for including outstanding user documentation. Both the quick start guide and more detailed user guides are nicely illustrated, well organized and understandably written.You can also integrate this speaker to be an output device from both Mac and PC computers via the included USB port. If your laptop has the sound quality of most laptops...the goodness of this idea is obvious.Keeping it one step from perfection was the puzzling decision to place many of the function buttons on the rear panel of the speaker. This is not an issue when you are controlling content from a connected device, but is rather annoying when playing from the SD card and you decide the time has come to skip forward or back. Overall, this is a minor gripe for a speaker that delivers major performance.Note: this item provided for review purposes.",

No excessive bending or creaking when applying pressure on the hub.  Definitely feels like a premium product.It has a very simple/minimal design to it.  Mostly of aluminum silver metal and a soft white plastic at the bottom.  The aluminum isn't a glossy shiny finish but more of a matte finish.  Which I prefer.  It has one blue LED to notify that the hub is connected to the computer.  The port that is used to connect to the computer is on the left hand side while the ports at the top are used to connect peripherals.  The bottom also has two non-skid rubber feet at the bottom.  Which is great thing as I hate it when hubs or accessories move around when trying to use them.  Simple and elegant enough design.  It definitely has some Apple-ish design cues.It has a very small footprint so it won't take up too much space of your work area.  Huge plus to me and it has no wasted space on it.Comparing the speed of the hub to directly in the usb 3.0 port there were little if any difference in real world testing and according to Crystal disk mark. (see attached photos).  So the hub definitely doesn't bottleneck the usb 3.0 port.Peripheral devices do work on this hub.  There are other hubs that doesn't play well with peripherals such as logitech mice or keyboards.  This hub definitely works with my Logitech MX anywhere mouse and logitech keyboard.*ConclusionFor a simple, non-powered usb 3.0 hub I don't think it can get much better.

In addition to the medium-size silicone tips that came already installed on the earphones, there are several other sizes and styles, including both bi-flange and tri-flange tips, and a set of Comply memory foam tips. With the earphone tips properly inserted in your ears, outside sounds are eliminated or at least heavily attenuated. And if the tips aren't inserted properly, the bass sounds are very weak, so it's important to use the tips that fit your ears the best.Attention to detail is one of the things that make fine products stand out, and with the S5 earphones, those details include a flexible ribbon cable, gold-plated plugs, and a &#34; screw-on stereo adapter plug. And thanks to Brainwavz for a really nice zippered hard case. It's easily the best hard case for a set of in-ear headphones that I've seen.If I had to come up with a complaint, it's a minor one: It's hard to read the &#34;L&#34; and &#34;R&#34; to know which earphone goes in which ear. The letters are on the strain reliefs, and I needed a magnifier to read them.The headphones were provided to me for evaluation and review.",

The monitor also randomly does this massive flicker, it is loud and obnoxious to say the least.

They're replacing a six-year old set of Logitech's that had a subwoofer and left speaker that was spotty at best (the the sound was fine when using them though headphones, however).Out of the box, the Z213's were a breeze to set up.  I simply plugged in the power supply and the jack to the back of my iMac and voila, up and running.The biggest difference between these and my last set is the volume/headphone jack box.  I could control the volume and plug in the headphone jack straight into one of the satellite speakers.  That created fewer wires and less hassle, in my opinion.  The Z213 has an extra cord to control volume - a set up that works well for my bedroom speakers, but I prefer the jack straight into the speaker for my desktop set.  It's simply a matter of preference, though.The speakers are nicely designed, look just fine next to my silver/black iMac and sound terrific.  A  nice feature is the adjustable bass levels on the back of the subwoofer.  I tend to prefer my bass a bit on the heavy side, so thumbs up for that.I feel that what you get for this price point is a fair value and would gladly recommend them to any prospective speaker buyers.",

This little beauty adds wireless capability to a wireless-incapable device with ease.The only caveat is that it needs a USB power connection to run. This is good if you have a spare charger and a spare power outlet, bad if you don't. It's not a big deal to work around, but it is something you will want to keep in mind.Connecting to the device is easy. Just plug it into power, let it power on. Connect the 3.5mm output to your audio setup with a 3.5mm input. On your phone or Wi-Fi enabled audio player, turn on Wi-Fi. Search for the Sabrent_A1AE and connect. Now fire up your music app, such as Music on the iPhone, and play away. Well, make sure your stereo is powered up and on the right input (or car stereo or surround receiver and so on).The nice thing about this is that it uses Wi-Fi. This means it doesn't have the compression issues you might hear or experience on a Bluetooth connection.Another option you can use is to create fake wireless headphones. This is kind of a joke of an option, as you need a power source, but if you want to cope with it, this can be done. I tried plugging this into one of the myriad of &#34;power banks&#34; I have. It powers up and allows you to connect. Once connected, plug in headphones and now you have headphones that are receiving wireless audio over a completely wired connection on the receiving end. It works, but not really what this seems to have been designed for.Another caveat you might have is that with the way the device is designed, you can't really have more than one of these in the house and connected at one time. The problem is that they all use the same wireless network name and static IP address, meaning you will never be sure which you are connecting to. Trial and error I guess. As I don't have the need for this, it's not a big deal for me, but for some it might be a deal breaker.Works well, sounds good and is easy to configure.Recommended.I received a free sample for review purposes from Sabrent.",

They often require you to relogin and you cannot keep the window open for more than 5 minutes before it forces you to relogin.

		"reviewText" : "With more and more devices these days requiring USB charger capabilities, it was inevitable that we'd start seeing chargers with more and more ports. With roughly a dozen USB devices of one kind or another, I need all the ports I can get. Two of the ports are higher-powered ports, suitable for Apple products and tablets of various kinds; the other two are lower-power, suitable for Android phones, Bluetooth headphones, and the like. Unlike some chargers, this has the power to charge on all ports simultaneously, although you will need to supply your own USB cables and Apple adapters.The charger is quite compact, about the same size as a similar two-port charger I've been using. One potential drawback is that there is no power cord: the device must plug directly into the wall. That's not uncommon and there is an easy workaround, to use an extension cord, but I figured I should note it.When I read a description like, &#34;Removeable Plug Portable Travel Charger,&#34; I expect to be able to swap the plug out with a plug more suitable to the locale to which I'm traveling. According to the manufacturer's website, you can get a version of this product with either a US, EU, or UK plug. But if there's a way to get any of the plugs by themselves, I was not able to locate it, either via a web search or the manufacturer's website. If you want all of the plugs, it looks like you have to purchase three separate chargers. I was able to locate the charger with the UK plug on the amazon.co.uk site. I wasn't able to locate the charger with the EU plug.I'm knocking off a star for that latter issue but otherwise I'm very pleased with this. I really like being able to charge so many devices at once and I like the convenient size. It does exactly what it claims and it does it very well. And at $12.99 at the time I write this review, it's very competitively priced. I have no hesitation in recommending it.Disclaimer: the manufacturer provided a sample for review purposes with no restrictions on the review outcome.

In comparing the two, the Altec comes out slightly ahead, mainly because it has a fuller sound. The Altec also feels heavier and the materials are higher quality.I know the Logitech has the bass control on the back of the subwoofer, but even adjusting it did not produce quite the same range as the Altec. Also, I'm not thrilled that the control is in the back. My desk space is cramped and having to fuss around with something on the back is aggravating. I guess they figured it'd mess with the aesthetics to put the control on the front.So I'm keeping the Altec for the PC, but this Logitech works pretty well with my Sony tablet.

		"reviewText" : "I got the Denon HEOS 3 and HEOS 5 for my dining room and kitchen. Unlike other cellphone speakers that I've purchased which are essentially docks, these are wireless speakers controlled nearly entirely by the phone. Both speakers are impressive out of the box, with very nice packaging and accessories (top-quality 3.5mm and Ethernet cables). Setup on both was simple, starting with downloading the Denon HEOS app to my smartphone. The app then takes you step by step through the setup process, connecting the 3.5mm cable to the phone and speaker and logging into my wifi network. It took only a couple of minutes before I was playing music from my phone.Sound quality is outstanding for a single speaker, each on their own. The HEOS 5, which is larger and offers a bit more bass over the HEOS 3, but more noticeable is the incredibly crisp highs... the HEOS 5 sounds incredibly sharp. The HEOS 3 is a bit of a step down in sound quality from the HEOS 5, but is still better then any other phone speaker system I've ever used. Even using just one as a single speaker, the sound fills the room thoroughly.The sound quality is really the only thing that separates the HEOS 3 and 5. The HEOS 5 offers no additional controls or features, although the HEOS 3 can be placed horizontally or vertically, and includes a screw hole on the back for wall mounting.Aside from the option to mute and turn the volume up or down on the speaker itself, the speakers are controlled entirely by the smartphone app. The app works quite well, with three main menu options. First is the 'Rooms' tab, which shows the list of HEOS speakers in your home, which in my case shows the HEOS 5 as 'Kitchen' and HEOS 3 as 'Dining Room', along with what's playing on each. Click on the appropriate speaker to change what's being played on them, or drag and drop one speaker on to another to group them to play the same thing. You can also set each speaker as a 'left' or 'right' for stereo sound.The next tab is 'Music' which allows you to select what to play on the selected speaker. The list includes Pandora, Spotify, Tunein, Rhapsody, as well as music from the phone itself. You can also select playlists or tell the speaker to play from the 3.5mm aux input on the speaker itself.The last tab is 'Now Playing', which shows what's being played on the selected speaker. Here you can skip, pause, or adjust the volume. Speakers that have been grouped on the 'Rooms' tab can have their volumes adjusted independently. In addition, there's a configuration menu to allow treble and bass adjustments for each speaker.The app works quite well, much better then I had expected. I'm not a big fan of app-controlled devices, but this one works nearly perfectly. There is no delay when inputting commands and the control I have over the speakers is perfect. My wife can turn the speakers on from her phone and I can see what's playing from mine and make changes.Overall, I'm very impressed by Denon's HEOS speakers. No complaints at all on the speakers themselves. As for the app, only one complaint... occasionally the app crashes, which seems to happen more often during start up. It's pretty rare, even for how much I use the system, so it's not a big deal. HEOS is new right now, so there will probably be a few wrinkles to iron out. Aside from that, the system is flawless and I plan to add at least one more HEOS speaker.",

		"reviewText" : "Overall, I'm pleased with the software and hardware stability of the camera. It's been reliable and I haven't found any major software bugs yet. Setup took me a few minutes using the NetCam app (for iOS) and connecting up to my secured home wi-fi, but the NetCam login works well and I was up seeing images on my iPhone and on my computer's web browser in just a few minutes. Belkin includes basic mounting hardware and a long AC adapter cord, which is handy so you can place the camera wherever you'd like.The picture quality is clear: whether I'm accessing from home or away (and the app still loads the camera pretty quickly, within a few seconds). It does seem to be about 720p quality and there are plenty of easy setting tweaks in the app. Images are shown with about a second delay when you are viewing on a high speed network connection. The app lets you save images/movies directly to your iOS library. The night vision IR by default is set to automatic - I was impressed by the images in the dark (though black and white, which is a limitation of night vision.)You can also communicate with the audio functions -- which I found surprisingly clear on both ends. By default, the camera sends you email every time motion is detected. I quickly shut this off as I was getting too many false positives. So far I'm not that trusting of the motion detection accuracy. Fortunately, there are options to tweak the motion settings so I'll need to get this just right over time. I haven't tried the WeMo integration (I do have a switch) as I'm waiting to tweak these settings. There's also no remote movement of the camera, but given the wide angle lens, I don't think this is a big deal.There is also the NetCam+ service, may still be in beta, which allows you to store a history of your images. For the price of the camera, this should be included, but yet only found a 30-day trial available to me upon setup and it's not clear what the final price will be. It's obvious that Belkin is trying to imitate theDropcam (DCAM-001-THD) Wi-Fi Wireless Video Monitoring Camera (DCAM-001-THD), which has a similar extended pay service. At least Belkin didn't ask for a credit card for the 30 day trial, but Dropcam offers some limited storage options with their included plan. Without Belkin's plan, there's basically no historical way to go back and see past images. This is main reason I'm docking the camera a star.Note that all my testing of this camera has been indoors and the motion sensing isn't the biggest feature for me, so that is reflecting my somewhat positive review. But for casual in-home use, I've found no problems with the apps or website (unlike other brands) so it gets my general recommendation.",

One thing to keep in mind, you will need to keep this unit powered via a USB port, but for me that is simple enough.Setup to your sound output system is as easy as connecting the cable, connecting your device to the Sabrent will follow similar setup to that of connecting a device to a wireless network.

What makes this unit `better' than Bluetooth receivers is that Wi-Fi can offer better quality sound transfer and has a greater range than the max of 30ft you can get from a typical Bluetooth receiver.Overall, a solid performer and offers a unique solution to improve upon the myriad of Bluetooth receivers on the market today.[Review Sample Provided For Review And Evaluation]",

		"reviewText" : "Trying to add extra USB 2 ports to a portable computer? Be it a tablet, laptop or other USB capable device, then the Sabrent 4 port hub, with it's light weight and easy portability is a great option for sure.I plugged this into my Surface Pro 3 and it was recognized immediately, no drivers needed. I've since plugged it into an older Surface Pro and my Windows 8.1 Dell XPS. The experience was the same. I then plugged it into my Windows 7 work laptop. No problems there either.Transfer speed is no better or worse than other USB 2 hubs.Just keep in mind, if you plug this into a USB 3 port, it will only work as fast as the slowest part, so in this case it will run as a USB2 hub because that's what it is.I can't stress how light this is. The ability to add 4 ports to my Surface Pro 3, so I can charge multiple devices from the SP 3, adds to the utility of it. Would it be great to be USB 3? Sure, but for me, it's not needed at all.Great device, easy to use and great portability.Recommended.I received a free sample for review purposes from Sabrent.",

		"reviewText" : "Picked up the i7 4790k at the Micro center in Denver because of the crazy low price as an upgrade to my NLE system at work. I was originally going to stick with my 4770k but Gigabyte released an update to support the 4790k on my GA-Z87-D3HP motherboard and the price was right so I made the upgrade. The higher base clock speed seems to speed up rendering time on projects by 10% to 15% depending on the effects in the timeline. Not extremally amazing, but a somewhat reasonable excuse to use my old 4770k as an upgrade for my gaming rig at home.Currently running it with a CORSAIR Hydro Series H60 and with no overclocking it seems to be running about 6 degrees C cooler than the 4770k at base clock. I did try a little bit of overclocking and pushed core voltage up to a bit over 1.25v and was able to get the clock up to 4.6 GHZ, but that's as brave as I was willing to be with a brand new processor.I'm glad Gigabyte is releasing updates for their Z87 boards, but I don't think the 4790k is a &#34;must have&#34; if you are already running a 4770k. Still a nudge up in clock speed and a drop in operating temp is always a good thing. If you are finally making the upgrade from an old i7-920 or a 2770k, spend a little extra and get the 4790k. If you already have a 4770k in your system, it's only a minor upgrade. Thankfully I can write it off as a work expense.",

However, I personally prefer the larger bulkier computer mice &#8211; they give my hand a wider grip that is more comfortable for prolonged use.The various LED light colors are really the most distinguishing feature of this mouse, and it&#8217;s probably the main reason why you would consider buying it in the first place. It&#8217;s a neat and flashy way of attracting attention and adding some color and vibrancy to your work environment. It would probably be the favorite option with the younger crowd, especially kids and teens. The LED light is pretty bright, and if you tend to leave your computer on overnight you might want to turn the mouse lights off &#8211; otherwise the light leakage might be seen across your home/office.The mouse works pretty well. I&#8217;ve used it with two of my Mac computers and my Windows 8 PC. It performed very well with all of them, although the initial precision settings were bit on a high side. Nothing that a quick change of settings can&#8217;t fix though.I really wish that this mouse were wireless.

		"reviewText" : "I received a single Heos 3 and a single Heos 5. This review is for both speakers with differences noted (hereafter referred to as 3 and 5).The future of our wireless world will include speakers located wherever you have an outlet with the ability to play whatever and however we want. The Heos gets this future half right by succeeding with the hardware and falling short with the software.HARDWARE-The 3 design is elegant, edgy, and modern especially when positioned vertically. The 5 has a more traditional, boring rectangular look and can only be positioned horizontally.-Both have a nice blue accent light at the base but no way to turn it off.SOUND-Treble and bass can be adjusted via the app.-The Heos 3 produces fantastic sound for a speaker of its size. Well-balanced in all frequencies. Crisp vocals. Surprisingly good bass.-The Heos 5 felt a little heavy on the bass even after adjusting the bass down. The vocals were not as crisp possibly due to the overdone bass.-Both speakers play loud enough to fill a large living room without distortion.-Overall, I prefer the sound of the Heos 3 as it is better balanced with crisp vocals without sacrificing much bass.MUSIC SOURCESCurrently, you are limited to only what you can play via the Heos app (Pandora, Spotify, TuneIn, Rhapsody, local phone files) which does not include Google Music, Amazon Music, or any podcast app. You also can't stream from a desktop computer to use Windows Media Player or a Youtube music video playlist.Since I have all my music and playlists on the Google Music cloud, the only way to use it with the Heos is directly connecting a 3.5mm cable to my phone's headphone jack. This is rather inelegant in today's wireless world.APP CONTROLS-Ability to group speakers to play the same music works generally well. I like how you can control volume of each speaker independently even within the same group.-I encountered some bugginess with the groups. Initially, when I tried to group the 3 + 5, the software would freeze. Sometimes when I grouped my 3 + 5, I would have another group of only the 3. My 2 speakers had magically become 3 speakers. With continued use, the bugginess seems to have resolved itself though.-Each Heos can play different music at the same time from the same phone app which adds flexibility.-I was able to aux cable connect my phone to the 3 and stream Google Music only out of the 5. That's pretty cool if you think about it. It makes me wonder why I need a wire at all.-It isn't obvious how to control each Heos separately and it isn't explained well in the manual. You must first go to the \"Rooms\" tab, select the group, then either go to the \"Music\" tab to select your source or go to the \"Now Playing\" tab to start/stop the music. You need to go back to the \"Rooms\" tab whenever you want to control a different speaker or group.OVERALLThe hardware is undoubtedly fantastic. For most people, I would recommend the Heos 3 over the Heos 5 because of its balanced sound and elegant design. If you want heavy bass though, go with the 5.The software could stand improvements in the ease of controls. More importantly, Denon MUST devise a way to allow you to use whatever sound source you want otherwise this will be a dealbreaker for many people. If you are like me and fully integrated into the Google Music player, the only way to stream is via a 3.5mm aux cable. C'mon Denon, this is 2014, not 1990. I'm not going to buy a product that turns my smartphone into a corded phone.If Denon can figure out a way to allow you to stream music from your phone in whatever fashion you choose, the Heos dramatically improves in value and is a solid 5 stars. The ability to stream from a desktop computer would add a ton of value as well.Denon has stated that the software will be regularly updated so I will update here accordingly.",

		"reviewText" : "I've had my hands on a lot of speakers over the years. I've always wanted that high end sound but could never afford the kind of speaker that produced it. I've come close with some shelf speakers but nothing ever came close to that concert hall sound at an affordable price. Until now. Sound Blaster has thought about just about everything that makes the listening experience amazing and easy.Sound: What can I say. It is AMAZING! It has two speakers in the front for high frequency sound (highs), a high excursion driver on top for bass and mid range sound, and two passive radiators on each side to enhance bass levels and widen the soundstage. What all that means is that it is so full and rich that it sounds like it is coming from a speaker grouping that is hundreds of dollars and much bigger. The technology inside is incredible.There are features built-in that make the sound even better when you need it. On top of the Sound Blaster is a ROAR button. That adds a super boost to the sound levels. Perfect for when you need to increase intensity without turning the volume way up and making it distort. Then there is a tera bass button. This is great for adding a little extra thump to your sound. I've been streaming radio and music of all kinds. The sound carries nicely to fill a room (the farther away the better sometimes) and I can hear it clearly across the house.Features: There are two ways to charge this, via the wall plug and USB. It seems to last a long time on one charge which means that portability is great. It has multiple inputs for music/sound. There is an audio jack (and audio cable - provided), a micro SD card, USB input, and bluetooth. It also will reconnect via NFC (near field communication) if you have already connected via bluetooth to your device. Just a tap from your phone to the corner of the speaker and it will auto connect.It has the ability to record as well. While I haven't tried this feature, it could be used to record a bedtime story for a child. This is great because it has a sleep function where it will slowly lower the volume for 15 or 30 minutes until it turns off.It has a built in alarm (not sure why but if you are camping or stuck somewhere and in need of a loud noise...) again, I haven't tried this out. I don't want to alarm the neighbors!Lots of features, amazing sound, compact size. And it comes with a carry case as well! This is well worth the investment.I was provided a unit for evaluation, testing and review.",

		"reviewText" : "Some people like DJ style headphones or earbud style headphones. For the audiophile needing a premium experience, you may be interested in the Brainwavz S5 In Ear Headphones.&#9654; Package Contents* Brainwavz S5 In Ear Headphones* Hard Carrying Case* 1 Set Comply Foam tips T-40* 6 Sets Silicon Ear Tips (S, M, L)* 1 Set Silicon Bi-Flange Ear tips* 1 Set Silicon Tri-Flange Ear tips* \" Adapter* Instruction Manual and Warranty Card (24 months Warranty)&#9654; AccessoriesAs other Brainwavz products, these earphones get several accessories that many other earphone brands wouldn't get. The contents come in a very well made hard carrying case, with two pockets, that will protect the earphones and accessories, as long as the damage isn't intentional, such as running your vehicle over it. The silicone tips are either gray or black. I like that this includes several different sized eartips that will work well with any ear size, which translates to sound canceling. This also includes one set of Bi-flange tips and one set of Tri-Flange tips that get optiminal in-ear sound, and foam eartips that tend to become damaged when removing them; no matter how well they improve the product. This also includes the \" adapter for stereos. I love that Brainwavz includes every accessory that you would typically need for a standard set of earphones.&#9654; Specifications* Drivers: Dynamic, 10mm* Rated Impedance: 16 Ohms* Frequency Range: 18 Hz ~ 24 kHz* Sensitivity: 110 dB at 1 mW* Rated Input Power: 20 mW* Cable: 1.3 m Y-cord; Silver-plated* Plug: 3.5mm, gold-plated&#9654; HardwareThe entire length of the earphone wire is 53 inches long. At the base is the gold plated connector, with black rings, that is enclosed by a rubber plastic material. I like that Brainwavz decided to keep the conventional straight connector, as their other connectors are usually at a 125  angle and easily damaged. From the connector, a flat gray rubber wire, 34\" inches to the Y connector, that is approximately 15.75\" inches to the earphones. The earphone casing is metal, although it initially looks like plastic, with the Brainwavz name, the earphones themselves are each tilted inward, probably around 30. These headphones are the successor to the Brainwavz S1, which also had premium sound, and are much lighter than the Brainwavz R3, which are their most expensive headphones. The R3's use more material, which supposedly translates to better sound quality.The earphones are designed to be worn over the ear, giving you the best acoustic experience, but you can choose to wear them directly in your ear. Wearing them over the ear greatly reduce microphonics, which are the vibrations transformed into electrical signals.&#9654; TestingI've tested these headphones for approximately two days, or about 12 hours of listening time, with my Nexus 7 (2013), LG Optimus F6, and Windows 7 PC. I used different genres of music and podcasts to properly gauge the quality of the earphones. The overall sound quality was very clear, and bass was excellent in terms of low, mid, and high bass. You could definitely tell the difference between these and the Brainwavz S1's, but there is little to no difference between these and the Brainwavz R3's. Taking into consideration the weight and size of the R3's, I would purchase these in an instant. During my extended tests, I felt no irritation from the ear tips. I was overall very satisfied by the fit, build, and acoustics of the headphones.&#9654; Final ThoughtsFor the quality and comfort, these headphones are hard to beat, especially for under the $100 range. I personally prefer them over the R3's, which are much more expensive and physically heavier. I would recommend this product to any audiophile needing earphones and give this product a 5 star rating.Pros:+ Clear sound and great bass during testing. I think these are on par with the Brainwavz R3's, a much more expensive earphone.+ Thin, light, and aesthetically pleasing.+ Includes several accessories, which not many other earphone manufacturers make.Cons:- Over the ear styled earphones aren't always for everyone.- Foam tips may become damaged if you take them off.I was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.",

		"reviewText" : "I set this up using a cheap Android-based LePan II tablet that uses Ice Cream Sandwich-no problems at all with the app installation. You can set this up one of two ways: by pushing your router's WPS button and then pushing the connect button on the back of the speaker, or by manually entering your router's password using the 3.5mm cable running from the speaker to your phone/tablet.HEOS 3: More than adequate for a 13 x 15 bedroom. This sounds best placed horizontally, but I'm considering ordering another HEOS 3 and making a left/right speaker set-up. There is a threaded mounting hole in the back of this speaker so you can mount this model to a bracket.HEOS 5: Used in a great room/dining area/kitchen area open space, roughly 17 x 17, 12 x 12 and a galley kitchen 10 x 12 feet. This has richer, deeper bass than the HEOS 3, more powerful sound overall but even when I change the treble setting for this speaker, I don't hear the crispness I get from the HEOS 3.My opinion of the two speakers is different than most. I prefer the HEOS 3 over the 5 since this speaker can be configured as both L+R, left speaker or right speaker for better separation. You can't do that with the HEOS 5, it's both L+R combined into one. I like the clean crisp sound I get from the HEOS 3 as opposed to the punchy bass the HEOS 5 puts out.You can change the bass & treble settings only for both speakers. I wish there was a graphic equalizer setting where you can auto-set it to the type of music being played, such as rock, soul, techno, jazz, country, etc. like many systems have.Combining both speakers to play the same songs is easy, just drag hold for a second or two and what really impresses me is the sound syncs perfectly. My condo isn't large enough to get away with playing different music in various locations.Not a lot to dislike...I wish the speakers had standard electrical plugs instead of large bricks. OTOH, I like being able to shut my tablet down after choosing my Pandora playlist, however, I can't thumbs-up/thumbs-down the music selections then. As far as buffering or breaking-up, no problems so far, even when streaming Netflix in another room and being on the phone-I use MagicJack for my \"landline\". (I have Comcast 25 Mpbs internet).I had never heard of Tunein before using the HEOS system. It's quickly becoming my favorite over Pandora, giving me access to hundreds of radio stations all over the world. And you don't have to set up an account to use it.CONCLUSION: While I like these, I think the development is in the early-stage. Where is Amazon cloud streaming? Where is streaming via my NAS? I think the speakers are a little overpriced. For the past year I've been streaming music thru a Denon CEOL system with conventional wired speakers which were cheaper but they don't sound much different than these.",

Belkin, though, insists that you use their apps to set up and manage your cameras, and those apps are clumsy, glitch, and just plain awkward to use.Do yourself a favor before getting this camera: Find the iOS and/or Android apps that Belkin has created for communicating with this camera.  Take a look at the reviews for those apps.  Then, look up some of the third-party apps that work with cameras from a variety of manufacturers.  There are some great apps out there, none of which will work with Belkin's NetCam.I had an older NetCam (2013 model, I believe), and found it difficult to set up and manage.  I was hoping that this latest version of their camera would come with a better app.  No such luck.  Same clumsy app, with improved camera hardware.To be fair, there are some things I like about the camera:* e-mail notification for motion alert worked very well.  I liked that I could fine-tune the trigger (broad motion, fine motion, repeated motions, and so on)* the image quality was decent because of the HD quality graphics.  However, when set at the highest quality, the video was very choppy.* I like that Belkin will allow you to store captured video on their \"cloud\" automatically, but I was disappointed that this requires a subscription to their service.  Given the cost of this camera, and the fact that I am tied to Belkin's own apps to use it, I would hope that such \"premium\" service would be included.Also, to be fair, I don't have any other WeMo devices installed right now.  Belkin advertises that this works well with those devices (for example, camera motion could be set to trigger your lights to turn on).  I can't speak to how well these features work.In my opinion, Belkin needs to do one of two things: Either create a new app, from the ground up, that is of much better quality than their current app, or \"open up\" the device so that it can be used with existing third-party apps.In the meantime, though, it is hard to recommend this updated NetCam.",

Once I figured this out it was a snap to stream music from my iPad 2.Nerd Alert's excellent June 26, 2014 review is spot on with respect to sound quality if you are using decent speakers. I tried this out with two Android apps that provide AirPlay capabilities and neither worked (they wereiMediaShare PersonalandAirBuddy). That is not the fault of this device, though. Since it works perfectly with a real Apple device the apps were the problem.Do be aware that you need to connect to this receiver via WiFi. For home use you have to choose between this or your router,  but for in your vehicle that should not be a problem. You can connect the output to any powered speaker or sound system using the 3.5mm jack. If your powered speaker employs RCA jacks you can use an adapter like anSF Cable, 12 feet 3.5mm Stereo Male to Two RCA Male Splitter Cable.Bottom line: this is a relatively small and lightweight receiver that can transform any powered speaker or stereo receiver into an AirPlay-enabled system. It's best suited for vehicles in my opinion, but is certainly not limited to that use. I gave it five stars because it works exactly per the product description's claims and is a breeze to install (my own fumbling notwithstanding.)",

		"reviewText" : "There's a lot to like but I'm feeling very frustrated because I'm sure this camera can be so much more.I set it up on my iPhone 5 and it was as about as easy as setting up a couple of Belkin WeMo wall plugs that I also have installed. Nice that the camera shows up not only on the NetCam app but also on the WeMo app. Quality of picture is great, as far as I'm concerned and voice is OK. I have it set up by the front door and like that it sends me an e-mail everything it detects motion. Then I can go to the app and potentially see what's going on.Here's a list of some of my frustrations. Some might just be my stupidity but some aren't. I can't find an app to download to my iPad, which, of course has a much bigger screen. Unlike any other photos or videos on my phone, I can't use the pinch function to zoom, so can't really see much... especially to recognize a face. The camera seems to be of good quality, so zooming should produce results... but the software doesn't seem capable. The menu tells me I can \"select a \"NetCam Cloud+ plan from your camera settings\" but I don't see it. The infrared lights on the camera bounce off my window, so at night all I see is a reflection. I'd put it outside but am afraid it might be stolen.With regard to motion detection, it seems to take a picture mostly once the action is over... delayed? Also, even though I have it on what appears to be the least sensitive setting, it is going off every time a car goes by on the street, rather than only when someone walks up to my front porch. There must be adjustments, but I haven't found them. I'm getting e-mail several times an hour, rather than several times a day.It sure beats stringing wires and I love being able to pull it up on my iPhone but it isn't much of a surveillance camera yet... at least not for me. Maybe one of you geniuses can help me solve my issues. ;)Update: I did get some helpful advice from Belkin. I can now view on my laptop and iPad. Plus, I have another option for setting sensitivity. However, no matter how I set it I am still getting too many notifications with nothing in the frame, which I assume is due to a delay between detecting motion and snapping the picture. Still rates four stars for me.  That's a better four stars than my original rating but still can't go to five.",

A TV and sound system that had previously caused endless grief with previous universal remotes finally worked, but the problem is that it takes almost 30 seconds to turn everything on.  If I use the individual controllers the TV and cable turn on much faster.  It may be because my Samsung sound system takes a while to start up and the controller turns the TV on at the same rate, but it is annoying.  In addition my Sound System and TV osed Samsung's AnyNet feature that allowed them to be turned on simultaneously.  This had to be disabled for the Logitech controller to work.I had never used a keyboard controller before, it actually has some use, but is not a one handed device.

I changed out so many parts it was ridiculous. I finally had enough and changed to this CPU (I used the EVGA Z97 FTW board) and right away that stutter just left as soon as it arrived. Now I'm not saying that AMD is bad by any means, look what's in the next gen consoles, but I sure was tired of fighting with the issue I had and Intel delivered the performance I was hoping for. This was my first Intel build and I have to say I'm a huge fan now. I know its a bit more expensive but it certainly was worth the extra money for it.

The Streambot Y bluetooth device solves this issue by providing a bluetooth connection between your phone and the car's audio system.Packaging: the Streambot Y came in a nice box with plenty of molded foam padding inside. Packaging was very easy to open and the product was nicely protected. Definitely a big step up from the hard plastic packaging found in most inexpensive electronics.Size: The device does stick out from the 12V outlet a bit, but on the upside, the FM transmitter part is attached to a flexible arm, so you can position it in the most convenient way. The lower (charger) portion contains a USB port for fast charging and is similar in size to most USB car chargers.Functionality:-The built-in charging functionality is great, because it means you are able to charge your phone while you stream. The charger was able to detect my phone and charge in fast (AC) mode.-The transmitter has a convenient volume knob, instead of buttons. I much prefer the volume knob, since it is much easier and faster to change volume compared to buttons.-There is a LCD display on the transmitter which displays the current station setting. This makes it easy to match the FM station on your car's stereo system to the proper station being transmitted from the device.-There are back/forward buttons on the transmitter so that you can skip tracks without using the touchscreen on your phone. Again, a very convenient touch.Ease of use:The Streambot Y came with an instruction sheet, but to be honest, the device is so easy to use that I never needed to use the instructions. All you need to do is plug it into the car's 12V outlet (while the outlet is powered on), and &#34;MPOW&#34; will appear in your phone's list of bluetooth devices. Simply pair via bluetooth, select a radio station on the device, select the matching radio station on your car's stereo, and you are good to go!Sound quality:This is one of the most important aspects of any car audio accessory, and I have been disappointed by the poor audio quality of FM transmitters in the past. However, I'm pleased to say that the Streambot Y has very good audio quality; it is almost as good as what you'd get through a 3.5mm auxillary jack, and certainly every bit as good as what FM radio stations normally sound like. I've experienced very little interference issues when using this transmitter. On the few times when I did get some interference, I was driving through a place where normal FM stations would also suffer from interference. So not really a fault of the device.Overall, I think this is a great device and I'm pleased with it so far.",

The touchpad works better than my couple year old Logitech pad, so they've made improvements there.  I prefer the smaller size and this would be my standard go to keyboard if it only had a keypad.There seems to be room for a keypad if they moved the Harmony logo to the middle and moved the touchpad up with smaller buttons. You'd expect a tv remote to have a group of number keys in one configuration or another. Having a keypad would also allow better placement of multi-function keys.I was able to use the Harmony hub from two rooms away. I didn't need the plug in antenna. There is also an extender for the usb receiver that makes it a little over an inch long. Using the receiver adds an almost imperceptible lag to keystrokes.  Having the Harmony hub  2 rooms away  caused keystrokes to intermittently duplicate or stick. It's best to have the hub as close as possible.The keyboard looks sturdy but there's no protection for the keys if you drop it. There is also no on/off switch.  You could probably drop it several times with no ill effects except for keys being inadvertently pressed.Logitech pointing devices have a universal receiver. After a certain date only one usb receiver is needed and it will handle any Logitech product.  Harmony is a different division of Logitech and the pointing devices don't work with the Harmony usb receiver.The keyboard comes with two usb receivers so you can set it up with two devices. I couldn't find any way to switch between the devices without unplugging one of the receivers or turning 1 device off. As far as I can tell the first device turned on is the device that is controlled.This is a great product.

It's a very teeny little light on the underside of one of the earbuds. It's almost easier to just pop in the headphones, turn them on and wait for the audible beep.I forgot to put in the &#34;fins&#34;, so that probably explains why every time I touched them to adjust the volume, they felt like they were going to fall out. So, yeah. Put the &#34;fins&#34; on/in. And make sure you select the right size of rubber tips.The sound is good: people can hear me just fine and I can hear them just fine. The only time I had someone complain about the sound quality was when I was calling from my car on the interstate. I think the ambient road noise was a bit much and caused the other person to struggle to hear me. Listening to music was a much better experience - no issues there. Sound is good and the noise cancelling works quite well.I found that taking/making a call with both earbuds in was very... uncomfortable. Since they are noise-cancelling headphones, it's odd to hear your voice when both of your ears are plugged. So, when I was on calls, I would just put one earbud in and leave the other one dangling.I love that these are relatively &#34;cordless&#34; - meaning, they're not attached to your phone. I chose to wrap them around the back of my head and didn't have any difficulty adjusting the sound. The volume up/down and &#34;call&#34; button are pretty close together on the cord, so you'll have to feel for them, but the middle &#34;call&#34; button is more raised, so you should be able to make adjustments without struggling too much.Overall, I really like them and they've proved to be a valuable device to have when roaming around the house and yard and making calls.

This isn't a big deal for listening to music, but if you try to watch a movie and have the audio playing through this receiver, the delay will drive you insane.

I tested this one along side the M3H4, and while the M3H4 struggled to write files in the low 100's MB/s this hub consistently wrote for me in the 120's MB/s. I was happy with the performance even if it did not have the looks I was going for.I rated this a four because it performed very well but just doesn't look as cool as some of the other Aukey hubs. I know, shallow right?",

		"reviewText" : "I've never seen something quite like this before... The Sabrent Wifi Audio Receiver is an interesting wifi-enabled receiver that gives you the ability to use your home network to play music from your mobile devices without having to be tethered to the actual iPad/iPhone/iPod. In the right situation, this could be very convenient.Set-up for the basic usage is simple. You plug the receiver into a USB port or charger, and that activates the wifi signal. The 3.5mm plug can be used with a set of headphones or an external speaker to pick up the music being streamed. Since I was using it with my iPad, I went into Settings and found the wifi signal that was being broadcast, and connected to it. From there, I could use AirPlay to stream my downloaded music to the speaker/headphones. I was surprised at how easy it was to use without any significant configuration.The downside of the design is that you need to connect your mobile device's wifi target to the Sabrent wifi signal, which means you won't be connected to your regular wifi for surfing or other uses. This limits you to what you can do while you're streaming music. Ideally you'd probably have your iPhone streaming to the receiver while using your iPad for surfing or other uses.Since you have to commit your device to the Sabrent signal, this isn't the &#34;perfect&#34; solution to streaming music to speakers. If you need/want to do music/surfing at the same time, maybe bluetooth would be better. But this is an interesting concept, and it's a device I plan on playing around with further.Disclosure:Obtained From: ManufacturerPayment: Free",

		"reviewText" : "I received the Logitech Harmony Keyboard for review via the Amazon Vine program. We immediately fell in love with this product. The Harmony system allows you to control all of your audio and video components from one keyboard instead of multiple remotes.  Even better, you can control everything from the free harmony phone or iPad app. We installed the app on both Android and iOS devices and had the same great results with both operating systems. I thought the set up would be difficult and time consuming, but all I did was enter the brand and model of each component into the phone app, and they all worked without any additional configuring.We are using the device with a television, blue ray, stereo receiver, Apple TV, and cable box.The real power of Harmony is that you can program in an activity like &#34;watch Apple TV&#34;and it allows you to specify which components need to be on and to which settings. So now when I hit one button, on my iPhone or android or the Harmony  keyboard, it powers on the television, stereo, and Apple TV, all with the correct input settings, ready to watch.  The real most powerful component of this product in our home is the hub that communicates with and ties together the components by bluetooth, wifi, and infrared as needed.  I will mainly use the phone app to control everything rather than the keyboard. No more remotes all over the table!",

		"reviewText" : "This is the perfect solution for road warriors and travelers. The unit provides two ports that are designed for any device, including Apple and legacy devices, and two that are also universal, but are optimized for Samsung and Blackberry devices.I tested it with a Samsung Galaxy Note 3, a Tab 3 10.1, an iPad2, an HTC Droid Incredible and a Kodak M763 camera. This charger charged them regardless of which port I used (and I purposely plugged the iPad into the Samsung optimized port and my Samsungs into the universal ports.) This leads me to conclude that not only does this charger have short circuit protection, but the ability to detect which device is plugged in and provide the appropriate level of charging current.My review sample came with the US two prong plug that did not require a specific polarity. The instructions showed other models of modular plugs from various countries, but no instructions on how to obtain them. However, the modular plug snaps into a standard figure eight connector, so you can purchase extension cords with the proper end and those will work.Of course it takes more than a cord, and this unit will auto sense and adapt to any AC voltage from 100 to 240, at either 50 or 60 cycles. So it is perfect for international travel.For domestic use I had no problems with any of the above-mentioned tests. Every device I tried charged (including a handful of bluetooth devices that I did not mention.) I am thoroughly pleased with it and it now occupies an outlet in my guest room with visitors and their inevitable array of 'toys'.",

		"reviewText" : "SABRENT has created a small, lightweight receiver that transforms any powered speaker or stereo receiver into an AirPlay-enabled system. It is a WiFi receiver so any of your devices set to use WiFi can use this. The instructions on the video included on the Amazon page are clear and easy to follow. It is not simply a plug and play device, but with a bit of patience putting it into use is relatively simple. The sound of course depends on the speakers you are using, but that is not a factor in this receiver. The most useful application seems to be for cars, but anywhere a WiFi bridge is needed. best suited for vehicles in my opinion, but is certainly not limited to that use. I gave it five stars because it works exactly per the product description's claims and is a breeze to install (my own fumbling notwithstanding.)As the package insert states, `Better than Bluetooth - AirPlay is lossless (no audio compression), has better range, no pairing limitations and supports multi-users; anyone can play DJ. Will work seamlessly with your existing Bluetooth hands-free setup (music will pause for incoming/outgoing calls and resume when call ends).' Grady Harp, July 14",

		"reviewText" : "The good:* Easy to set up with a mobile app. When you power on the camera, it creates its own wi-fi network. You tell your iPhone or Android device to use that network, run the free mobile app, and associate it with your normal wi-fi network and an online account.* Cheap. Wi-fi cameras are really coming down in price, and this is in the middle of the low end price range* Mobile app works well at home and away. It's smart enough to use peer-to-peer if the mobile device and camera are on the same network, and it relays through a third-party service if one is away* Integrates with the WeMo app. It can be used as a motion detector to trigger power on/off rules on other WeMo devices.* The IR vision actually works. Often these are muddy and unusable on low-end cameras. Here it's decently crisp* 1280x720 resolution (720p) makes the camera quite usable even at a distance of 20-30 feet* Built in microphone works fairly well, even when subjects are 10 feet away* A website is provided for viewing the camera in a regular browser. Flash is all that's required.* The mobile app can save snapshots and video clips directly to the camera roll (tested on iPhone) - the video integration was a nice surpriseThe bad:* No matter what, you're not getting a decent framerate out of this. It looks like 8-10fps despite the listed specs, even when little is changing in the frame. There's also a significant lag (2-3 seconds) that you just won't get rid of with the web view. Less on the mobile app.* Big mobile app annoyance: Every time one switches to the mobile app, it plays a pointless animation. Every. Single. Time. If you toggle between the camera and text messaging for example, you will watch this animation for what feels an eternity. It doesn't even resume the last active camera view, even if only leaving the mobile app for 2 seconds.* Wide-angle view that you can't disable. It works relatively well for up-close objects. But there's significant fish eye on anything even 5 feet away. This is definitely a surveillance camera, not usable for chatting or other such uses.* The built-in two-way audio feature is nearly useless. Audio from the camera to the mobile device works fairly well, but the speaker in the camera is difficult to hear. It has loud midrange and little else, making it sound like a typical drive-through speaker. Don't expect to be able to use this to talk with kids from far away, and it scares the hell out of my cats.* Little adjustability for the motion detection. My cats set off the motion detector constantly, so I can't use it for security or notification about human visitors. Some other cameras allow setting triggers based on the type or amount of motion, while also allow rejecting motion low in the frame to deal with pets.* The website squashes the aspect ratio to 4:3 despite this being a 16:9 aspect camera.* The website disconnects after about half an hour and needs a new login each time. It does not work as a peer-to-peer connection even if on the same network, unlike the mobile app.* There doesn't seem to be any support for third-party camera software, or a way of viewing multiple camera feeds at once without manually opening a bunch of browser windows.Verdict:If you want a cheap temporary surveillance camera that's easy to set up, requires no wires apart from the power cable, and have an existing wi-fi network, this is a decent choice. Don't expect to make good use of this with multi-camera setups, always-on surveillance, two-way communications, or for any other advanced use.Note:I didn't count this as a negative since it's not how most home networks are set up, but I did have some trouble with the wi-fi configuration on a network that had multiple wireless base stations in order to extend range. (An example of this would be multiple Apple Airports, each wired to ethernet, and each configured to broadcast the same SSID and use the same password.) The Belkin app repeatedly failed to configure the network when I would pick the SSID from the network list, where the same SSID was also shown multiple times. Choosing the option to attach it to a \"different network\" and then manually typing the SSID worked. If you have a similar whole-home setup with multiple base stations, this may save you some grief.",

		"reviewText" : "I finally feel like I'm somewhat on par with my Sonos music friends... :)  I received the Denon HEOS 3 and HEOS 5 wireless speakers from the Amazon Vine review program, and this is an item that I've been anxiously awaiting. After using it for a few days, I am very impressed with the ease of use and sound quality that the HEOS speakers offer. Setup was a breeze, and I'm actually starting to listen to music again during the day while I work.I expected to encounter some level of pain trying to connect the speakers to my wireless network... not because I have a strange network, but just because those things don't seem to work very intuitively. Much to my surprise, it was close to plug-and-play. I downloaded the HEOS app to my iPhone and unboxed the speakers. Side note on the packaging... high quality and classy packaging... it speaks volumes (a slight pun intended) for what's inside. Set-up involved plugging the speaker into a power outlet, plugging a small cable into the speaker and my iPhone, and pressing the Connect button on the back of my speaker. The iPhone app takes it from there. Both my speakers connected in less than 30 seconds and were listed as separate speakers on my device list. They also updated the software automatically and &#34;rebooted&#34; each speaker. At that point, I had a HEOS sound system!The sound quality is exceptional (to my admittedly non-audophile ears). The bass and treble ranges are excellent, and even at louder volumes there's no distortion. The HEOS 5 (the larger of the two speakers) does have a richer sound, but not by much over the HEOS 3. I have the HEOS 5 down in my mancave office where I can crank it a bit, and the HEOS 3 is up in my wife's sewing room. She loves having something better than her tinny PC speaker now. Even though I have a decent sound system hooked up to my PC, I'm enjoying the HEOS sound more (and liking that my computer isn't running my music programs).The HEOS app is, in my opinion, pretty easy to work with. I set up the speakers using my iPhone, but I wasn't sure what I would get when it came time to set up the app on my iPad and wife's iPhone (and an older one at that). No worries... she downloaded the application, started it up, and it automagically found both speakers on the network with no prompting or searching. She was playing music from her iPhone in less than five minutes after downloading the app. Any time I don't have to play computer or iPhone tech support, I'm happy.Based on my (again, admittedly more limited than some of my friends) music sources, I was pleased with the options for streaming to the HEOS system. The iPhone app recognizes Pandora, Spotify, Tunein, Rhapsody, and the actual iPhone/iPad. I have my limited music collection on iTunes (and sync'd with my iPhone), so I was happy to play from there to the HEOS. I sort of &#34;rediscovered&#34; Pandora over the last few days, too. I've been enjoying putting it on one of the &#34;radio station&#34; channels I had in my Pandora account, and just letting it play over the HEOS. Over time, I'd like to see more music sources be available, but for my typical usage, this is a good selection.My friends are always raving about their Sonos systems and how they can have different music playing in different rooms controlled by different people. I used to think &#34;so what?&#34; as it wasn't that important to me. Now having played with the HEOS system, I &#34;get it&#34; and will forever be spoiled by not having to listen to music via headphones or less-than-wonderful speakers. I'll also be spoiled knowing that I can move my speakers around to any room if needed, and I can create ambience wherever I'm at in the house.Disclosure:Obtained From: Amazon Vine Review ProgramPayment: Free",

There are two dedicated amplifiers to support the very accurate and even sound reproduction.  There is no distortion even at higher volumes.However, the sound can be easily customized.  If a bass emphasis is desired, there are two buttons to adjust bass and the effect of overall intensity.  The TERA bass button increases bass dynamically at lower to moderate volumes and in rooms with poor acoustics.  The ROAR button boosts overall loudness and creates a more open sound and is very enjoyable even at close range.  These functions can be activated separately or simultaneously.Further customization is supported by the Sound Blaster Control Panel software when connected by USB cable to a computer.  The software provides nine preset profiles for music, films, and gaming, and these profile settings can be calibrated to taste.  It's a complete sound control panel but in software form.Bluetooth 4.0 with AptX and AAC codecs connects painlessly as \"SB Roar SR20A\" and will also support NFC connections.  Wired connections can be made to a computer either with the included USB cable or to any audio device with a 3.5 mm jack with an included audio cable.  Another option is using a microSD card to play MP3, WAV, and WMA files.  There is a built-in microphone that works well for calling and teleconferencing.  Other fun features include random loud sounds mode, bedtime mode, siren, and voice recorder.The large-capacity 6,000 mAh lithium-ion battery provides seven to eight hours of listening at normal volumes over Bluetooth and there is a 1 A USB port for charging small electronic devices, such as a paired smartphone.It ships in a nice frustration-free box that can be used for storage and includes a user guide.  It has a one year warranty.  Accessories available include aproprietary cablefor pairing and amesh carrying bagwith a shoulder strap and hand loop for portable use.It is difficult to compare the Sound Blaster Roar to other portable speakers because it is a big step up in audio quality and features from anything I have seen in its price range, making it an excellent choice for daily use as a primary personal speaker, especially where space is limited, as well as for portable use.

		"reviewText" : "Tested both the HEOS 3 and HEOS 5 as part of an Apple Airport based wifi system, with Verizon FIOS high speed throughput, and iOS app. The two speakers are similar, with the HEOS 5 being a bit larger, heavier, and having better overall sound quality.Packaging is what one would expect from a high-end manufacturer, comparable to Apple/Oppo/etc. Packaging includes the mini-mini audio cable, ethernet cable, AC converter, the speaker, and clear directions. The HEOS 3 speaker itself can be bolted to the wall or can sit vertically or horizontally. I preferred the sound with a horizontal placement, but note that there is a significant degree of variability depending upon what you use as a base. For example, in the kitchen, if you place the speaker on a granite countertop, you will have quite a bit more high end due to reflectivity than if you place the speaker on a wood cabinet top near the ceiling of the room. The HEOS 5 has a single orientation and no wall mount.Setup took just a few minutes including the download of the HEOS app, firmware upgrade for the speaker, and entering my wifi system password. No bugs encountered with setup and the app is just about ready for primetime. There was one point where I entered a \"Demo\" mode by accident through the Local Music entry; the app had no clear method for exiting and returning to standard playback. I reset it and started over.Sound quality is superb, especially considering that with a single speaker, you are essentially listening to a mix down of 2 channel audio to a single source. With two speakers, one would think there would be a way to set one as the Left channel and the other as the Right channel, but this is possible only for the HEOS 3, which can be set as L, R, or L+R. The HEOS 5 is always providing both channels in one container, leaving you with wanting two HEOS 3's if you want one as L and the other as R. Bass is quite good on the HEOS 3 - more vibrant and less boomy than with competing products. There's a nice midrange for vocals, which are easily interpreted over the music, and the high end, while not quite as full as I'd like, can be equalized up within the app. The HEOS 5 has significantly improved low midrange and upper bass response, and the 3 is somewhat muddier by comparison, something I hadn't noticed when I originally listened to the 3 by itself. I chose the kitchen for the HEOS 3, where music is often competing with cooking noises, exhaust fans, hums of various appliances, and conversation. The ultimate in stereo isn't necessary, but good high fidelity sound is. The HEOS 3 easily provides the necessary volume and frequency response without clipping or distortion. In a day of playing, I experienced no wifi dropouts or other such difficulties. The software allows the two speakers to run the identical source, at user-selectable volumes, or two independent streams of music (one room for partying, the other for relaxation?).Music sources include any music on my iPhone, which will then stream via wifi to the speaker. The HEOS app includes access to your existing accounts on Spotify, Pandora, and Rhapsody. I used my Pandora account without difficulty. I tried to access my Beats account, but this didn't work through the HEOS app. The only way to use Beats at the moment would be to connect it to the HEOS with a hard wired connection from my iPhone. I understand Beats will be supported in the future however. I tried my Spotify premium account but all that happened is that the HEOS app launched the Spotify app, which then played through the iPhone rather than streaming. After searching online, I discovered that there is, in fact, a way to utilize Spotify through a completely non-intuitive user interface (Spotify's fault, not Denon's) that can be accessed only through the Now Playing section of the app rather than from the Settings section. So now I can use my own library, Spotify, and Pandora.Overall this is a well-constructed product with very good software support. I'd look for just a little more clean-up on the HEOS iOS app to get the UI just right, and greater availability of specifications so users can easily figure out how/whether they are getting mono R, mono L, or a mix down of both channels, as well as instructions as to how to set this as a user with each speaker being placed.",

		"reviewText" : "OK, I was skeptical that these could work well enough that I'd want to use them for more than the evaluation but, to my surprise, they do work that well. In fact, I'm listening to Internet radio playing on an iPad over 30 feet (9 m) away as I write this.This system consists of two earbuds connected by a wire with a tiny control center / microphone near the right earbud. If you look at the picture, the heavy area in the connecting wire is the control center / microphone.The earbuds come with three different butyl rubber earpieces of different sizes (S, M, L). Unique in my experience to these buds, they also have 'orcas' which are soft 'rubber' fin-like things which fit around the buds. These 'orcas' swivel on the buds allowing you to optionally hook them into the ridges making up your ear.I found these orcas made it possible for me to wear the buds because I'm one of those unfortunates whose ear canals are too shallow to retain buds for more than a few seconds. The slight added retention afforded by he orcas make this system, if not secure in my ear, at least solid enough that I can walk around without the buds dropping out as is the case with all other pure ear buds.Pairing the earbuds was quick and easy. They charge using a supplied USB to USB mini cable but there is no charger included. The controls allow summoning Siri for Apple devices and controlling volume and track for all.The quality of the sound is more than good enough for phone calls.  No, these aren't reference grade buds but they do work well enough to enjoy music ripped at a sample rate of 256 kbps. They are just fine for streaming Internet radio.There are two issues, however. While the orcas are an innovative idea for earbud retention, they aren't nearly as good as over the ear retainers such as many athletic earbud setups use. The orcas only weakly add to the retention meaning the earbud rubber needs to exert pressure on the ear canal for the balance of the retention solution but this pressure grows weary after a few hours use. The over the ear buds, by contrast, can be worn all day without any strain on the ears.The other issue is the microphone which doesn't shut off. So when using these earbuds you are aware of your own breathing and also your voice should you speak while wearing them. The good side of this is that you are aware of sounds around you with the earbuds in due to the mic picking up any and all sounds. I can, for example, hear my typing as I write this while I'd not using earbuds lacking an always on mic.Aside from these minor reservations, and the always on mic may be a feature, these almost weightless earbuds are pleasant and easy to use.

		"reviewText" : "This battery charger is designed only for charging AA or AAA batteries. You can charge any combination of four batteries at a time. You can charge either Ni-MH or Ni-Cd rechargeable batteries. You can't charge regular alkaline batteries with this charger. I have a couple other battery chargers and one of them is just like this one but my other one can actually recharge standard alkaline batteries. Regular alkaline batteries are much less expensive that rechargeable batteries so that was a nice option to have. Another big difference is that my other chargers can also charge 9 volt, C and D batteries and unfortunately this charger can't do that either. My other chargers were between 3 and 4 times more expensive than this one so that's something to consider. Another good point is that AA and AAA are by far the most common batteries that I use. I only occasionally use C and 9 volt batteries and I hardly ever use D batteries at all.My other chargers are about six or eight times larger than this one and I like how compact this charger is. Visually I like the look of this charger better that the others. It can easily plug into any outlet and hang out of the way. Since it's super small it's easy to take with you as well. It can be handy for recharging AA batteries for digital camera while on vacation. We also have some Air Hog toys that take a lot of AA batteries and it's good for that as well. It has a nice blue LCD screen that is very easy to read. It shows each battery as it's charging and how fully charged it is. It's simple to tell when your batteries are finished charging. This charger also has a depleting function for draining the power from your batteries prior to charging them. Neither of my other chargers have this function and that's a huge plus. This will give you the best possible charge and long term battery life. I like that when not in use the plug folds into the charger. That makes it easier to throw into a bag and not snag on anything. The only thing that I don't like is that the plug is in the left side of the charger instead of the middle. I guess it really doesn't make a difference but it just looks a little odd.This charger will fully charge your batteries overnight and the charge seems the same as when using my other chargers. It's my charger or choice for AA or AAA batteries but I wish it could charge C, D or 9 volt batteries. But again the cost of this charger is the lowest that I have seen for a quality charger. If you only need to charge AA or AAA batteries then this would be a very good choice.Sample provided for review.",

		"reviewText" : "My wife and I were looking for notebooks for our kids (9 and 11 yrs old). DELL had a sale for $200.00 for this model, and we could not pass up the opportunity. All in all, this is an excellent laptop for kids or very basic laptop for a family.PROS:1. CHIP: Intel Celeron (dual core). This is a latest Celeron chip (N2830, Bay Trail - M) you will have. Being a dual core can handle most of the demands easily. Because it is a Bay Trail chip, it is quiet and not heavy on your resources. It is so quiet, you hardly hear the fan at all. So for your Web browsing, emails, YouTube viewing, MS Office, some gaming, and every day chores, this is a great basic laptop.2. BUILD. The black matte finish is not fancy but functional. Simple but sturdy. The keyboard has no flex, and comes with chiclet keyboard that is well designed and generously spaced. The screen is bright and resolution is normal for this price range.3. PRICE. Price differs from store to store, but if you get it in right time, you might get it for around $200.00. Even $250 is a good price. To give you a comparison: various Chromebooks are priced in this range but with less functions and memories. Additionally, you CANNOT install any Windows programs (such as, MS Office, etc), so while Chromebooks have their proper place, for those who need basic laptop for general use, this laptop might be a better fit in this price range.4. OS. Windows 8.1 is far, far better than Windows 8.0. If you already have 8.0, then you should update/upgrade it to 8.1. I love using it, and my kids love the tiles. PLUS, I love 8.1's Family Safety feature. I can control how much my kids can be on the computer and what days. Additionally you can also filter what kind of web they are browsing. MS also sends you (the parent) weekly report on the kids use of the computer. Love this feature! Easy to set up and monitor.CONS:1. No optical Drive (DVD/CD). But nowadays, this is not really needed anymore. But for those who need it, you might have to consider other models.2. No Bluetooth. The box says, \"Bluetooth\" but this is misprint. This model does NOT have Bluetooth.3. Only 2 USB (2.0) ports. I was hoping that it had another USB port.Despite the cons, considering its price, this is an excellent entry laptop for kids and those who just want sturdy, dependable laptop for every day general use. Highly, highly recommended!",

Being a seasoned traveler, and often visiting clients on site, I needed a simple but reliable USB 3.0 travel hub to expend my notebook limited connectivity. This economical and functional item worked out great for me. It lays flat by design and allows for easy plug in of your devices. I have used a 64 gig corsair USB 3.0 flash drive (to show presentations), a 1 TB Western Digital USB 3.0 hdd, charged my Nexus 5 and Bluetooth portable speaker, all with this device. No performance issues at all. It performed as designed and proved indispensable for me while on the road.

No cramping here.* Obviously, this is a USB 2.0 Hub so don't expect awesome speed from it.* From a charging perspective, there was a measured 20% loss in output when comparing the raw USB charging output with the output through the hub when only one device was connected.

		"reviewText" : "First, it's a great value for what it is-- let me get that out of the way.I've been a rechargeable battery user for many years-- maybe even earlier than the Rayovac Renewals and even the NiCad batteries. I have never been one to spend a lot of money on the sophisticated chargers that give a digital readout on each cell, but I also don't buy the cheapest chargers. I've typically spent a bit more on the rapid 15 minute chargers and have been generally pleased with those. My last two were Energizer brand.What this has that a good quality rapid charger doesn't have is that it charges each cell independently. If you have  bad one, the others charge anyway. With my rapid charger, if one cell is bad you have to remove it, and it doesn't tell you which one. Often you can just put the hand across and see which one is cold, remove it, and try again. If charging continues more than a second, you've removed it.This one also has the drain & recharge feature that the rapid charger doesn't have.I really like this charger, though it is not a rapid charger, because it has some additional functionality that my rapid charger doesn't. It can step in when I have a battery that won't charge (charging from 0v) and to drain and recharge. That being said there are a couple design features that could use improvement on this model.The LCD is very hard to see unless you are looking at it head-on. I do my charging on the kitchen counter and the wall outlet is between waist and stomach level. At that angle I have to get directly down over in front of it to see the status. The good news is that the light stays blue until it's done, so I don't *have* to investigate every time. The second design thing I had was how the AAA battery fits in the unit.  While the unit has instructions written in very clear English, it doesn't describe that the AAA battery fits in at an angle where the + side tilts out from the body of the charger. Once you learn & discover how this works, it is not an issue, but that needs explained. All of my previous chargers let the AAA fit body-flat against the charging base just like the AA, so this was completely unexpected. I'm surprised I didn't break the charger during this discovery/trial stage.Overall, I was really pleased with the charger. If it were a rapid charger as well, it would really elate me, but short of that it has some functionality that my rapid charger doesn't have, I can live with the LCD angle issue and after learning that the AAA tilts out, it's a pretty solid and functional kit. I'd have no concerns buying this charger for my dad as a gift.By a lot of patient hours, days and years of reviewing, I found myself in the top reviewers on Amazon. This wasn't a goal or result of self promotion, but by focused reviewing. I sometimes get contacted by manufacturers or sellers who ask that I provide an unbiased review. This is one of those products. I assure you that I review what I want, when I want, how I want, in order to share what I feel is the most accurate useful information.",

		"reviewText" : "Bluetooth speakers have improved a lot over the past couple of years, but I never thought I'd hear one that sounds this good, especially at this size and price range. This speaker has a solid, substantial look and feel. It has 5 drivers and a built-in subwoofer so it also sounds substantial and solid. The sound fills our kitchen/family room/dining area which is around 45' x 24' with bump outs for a dining area and lots of windows and doors, and 10 foot ceilings. Yeah, it's an acoustical nightmare. But the ROAR fills this Great Room with crisp, clear sound and amazing bass. People that walk into the room invariably ask where the sound is coming from and have a hard time believing this little device is ROARing out this amazing sound!I know that Creative has a solid reputation in the area of sound. My very first purchase of a computer add-on 2 weeks after buying my first computer was a Creative Sound Blaster sound card which I installed, with their instructions, having never seen the inside of a computer before. And it worked right away! So I became a loyal customer, installing several of their sound cards over the years. I'm glad they have reinvented the Sound Blaster in some of these new products.This speaker has a bi-amplified design meaning it has dual opposing sound radiators with five drivers. These disperse frequencies forward while the active bass unit disperses midrange sound upward for height while the side firing radiators deliver the bass that fills the room, even a large one like ours which is a real challenge for any speaker system let alone a single speaker such as this. Walking into this room you would never suspect such room filling sound could accomplished by this little device. This not only sounds great &#34;for its size&#34; but for any size. It sounds a whole lot larger than it actually is.Besides it's amazing sound the Sound Blaster Roar has a bunch of other great features. It has a high-quality microphone for clear voice pick up, making useful for speakerphone teleconferencing or just answering your smart phone. It has integrated MicroSD, WMA MP3 players meaning that you can play music directly from a microSD card without having to connect another device. (You can also connect a device with a cable with 3.5m connectors.) It has an integrated voice recorder, with one touch audio recording of voice calls of music directly to a microSD card. If you have an NFC enabled device you can connect it via Bluetooth. You can also connect two Bluetooth enabled devices at the same time. There are lots of link security modes so you can control how Bluetooth devices are able to connect the ROAR.It comes with a plug-in battery charger and provides about eight hours of continuous audio playback. You can also charge your smart phone with it. You can connect via USB to a PC or Mac computer. SoundBlaster Control Panel software is available for free download that will enable advanced audio processing. A lot of thought and engineering went into this speaker and it shows. Quite simply, the best Bluetooth speaker I have heard so far. Two thumbs up!I received a sample of this speaker from Creatve for testing and review.",

		"reviewText" : "I am a big fan of Apple's Bluetooth keyboard. I like its compact size, elegant design, and, almost more than anything else, the feel of its keys while typing. They provide the exact amount of tactile feedback that I like, and I almost don't like typing with any other keyboard. However, one of the shortcomings of this keyboard is the lack of separate numerical keypad that used to be the staple of most computer keyboards for as long as the personal computers have been around. Granted, I don't enter significant amount of numerical data any more, but every once in a while when I need to do some quick calculations I miss the actual separate numerical keypad. For the past year or so I had coopted the trackpad to do the job of a numerical keypad with the use of Mobee Technology Magic Numpad. However, this setup is far from ideal - I don't have the tactile feedback that I am so used to, and the surface of my trackpad has become decidedly less smooth and responsive. All of these shortcoming are the major reason why I am still interested in having an actual physical keypad, and this Satechi keypad seems to fit the bill.The Satechi keypad is very clearly designed to look like the Apple's keyboard and trackpad peripherals. However, unlike the Apple peripherals, it is not made out of aluminum but rather out of plastic. If you are just casually glancing at your work area desk you would not notice this difference though, but once you start typing the similarity disappears. The action of the keys is also softer than that of the Apple's keyboard.The setup was very straightforward. This is plug-and-play USB keypad, and plugging it into one of the available USB ports is all that's needed for it to be recognized by an Apple computer. The keypad is compatible with both the Mac computers as well as the Windows machines. It might also be compatible with some tablets and Linux computers, but I have not tested it with either one of those.This keypad is fairly rudimentary and I would have liked for it to include a few additional keys. They page navigation keys would have been nice, as well as a separate key for launching the calculator app on your computer. Even better would have been an inclusion of programmable keys. This would have made this keypad a very powerful tool in more sophisticated spreadsheet manipulations, advanced scientific calculations, or even as a gaming keypad.This is a really good product, and a welcome addition to my workspace. However, I think it's a bit on a pricey side. A price point that is $5 -$10 less than the current $20 on Amazon would make this keypad much more appealing to the general casual users. Furthermore, these days I am not too keen on wired peripherals, and much prefer to use the wireless ones whenever possible. Satechi makes another similar Bluetooth keypad as well and I would recommend that you check it out if you are more inclined towards wireless devices.**** Product sample provided for review purposes. ****",

		"reviewText" : "My house has suffered from a break-in in the past, and since then, I've been looking for various ways to protect my home.  One such measure was to get a wireless security camera.  The Belkin NetCam is actually the second cam I've owned, but it's probably the better of the two.One of the biggest positives was how easy it was to set the NetCam up.  Activation is completely wireless (unlike my previous camera, a Foscam) and the included quick start guide made for a fast, easy installation that took less than 10 minutes.  The camera's set up is done via an iOS or Android app, which, while barebones, is easy to use and understand.Speaking of the app, I use the iOS app on my phone, and it works great.  I can view live video, turn the microphone on/off, and activate the speaker.  The other camera I had used a web-based interface, which wasn't as easy to use, though, admittedly, it did allow for more detailed control.  I prefer the smartphone/tablet app route, as it makes monitoring my camera much easier.Another positive for me is picture quality.  My previous camera's resolution was 640x480.  This camera's output is 1280x720.  Plus, it has a wide angle lens, so it can capture more of an area (as compared to my old security cam).  This camera also features infrared lights, giving the NetCam night vision.And my final reason for liking the NetCam so much is its compact size.  It's much less conspicuous sitting on my shelf compared to my other camera, which was easily twice as large.As for cons, the Foscam I had had pan and tilt, which means I could remotely control where the camera is aimed.  The Belkin NetCam doesn't feature that.  It's on a swivel arm and once you set it, that's it.  As a security cam or baby monitor, that's usually not a big deal, though, so I'm fine with that.I also don't care for how frequently the camera emails me photos because it detected &#34;motion.&#34;  I don't know what it's picking up on, but I get dozens of email a day, with ZERO real activity.  I can easily foresee a &#34;boy who cried wolf&#34; scenario, where a real problem could go unnoticed until it's too late, because the owner thinks it's just another bogus email.  To be fair, my Foscam suffered from the same problem.That, coupled with the fact that the camera seems late in snapping security photos may render this useless for many.  In my use, the camera is sitting on a shelf facing my front door.  If I set motion detect sensitivity to low, it reduces the number of false alarms, but it either completely misses REAL activity (my entering or leaving) or has blurred or mis-timed photo (my back as I close the door).  If I set it to high, I get a lot more false positives (tons of emails) and it still is hit-and-miss (though it does give me more useable photos).  In this regard, the Foscam was better.  I still suffered from tons of emails, but I had more usable photos.Overall, I'm still happy with this camera and will use it to replace my Foscam.  It fits better in the location I have it, I prefer the field of view the lens gives, and the app makes it much easier to use.  I'd recommend it more as a baby monitor or live feed camera, as opposed to strictly as a security camera, but it does an OK job in that regard, too.  A soft four (maybe 3.5) stars.",

		"reviewText" : "Let me get the disclaimer out of the way in saying that this review is based on a beta version that I received through a beta program. With that said do keep in mind that some things may differ from the final retail product but for the most part part things should generally be the same.Ill do my best to keep this review straight to the point. Also keep in mind that my previous highest router was a Netgear WNDR3700 running third party firmware Gargoyle. To make a comparison to this router isn't really fair but its also my only point of reference.DesignYou either love it or you hate it. In my opinion the design looks industrial, futuristic and maybe even over the top with the antennas extended out; it makes me think of a Robotic Spider. The design may not have the universal appeal of the previous R7000 but I like it.Design Pros:-Open vents on top for great airflow and heat dissipation but with this increases the possibility of dust being collected over time  (Keep that router clean) but overall this is worth the trade off.-Ability to switch LEDs ON or OFF-Unit comes in a matte black finish (I like that this finish reduces the look of finger prints, dust, and scratches)-Having all ports on the rear is a plus as it makes wall mounting setup/cable management easier to deal withDesign Cons:-Router has a large foot print-The antennas when extended do feel delicate and the design is such that the antennas on this unit aren't user replaceable. Same if the unit is wall mounted and you have the antennas projected outward. (Be careful!) This isn't an issue if the unit is set in area out of the way.-When wall mounting the text on the router is upside down but this is a minor quip-Little to no tactile response when pressing the buttons on top of the routerUsability/PerformanceStraight up - This router performs!!! I've had 10 plus devices connected to this thing at one time at least half of those devices were streaming and or downloading content and this router didn't skip a beat! Top notch performance! Now I have to say for the techies doing heavy torrenting and/or usenet depending on the setup of those apps you could still negatively affect or impact your network if you choose to max out connections using said apps however again for normal everyday situations this router screams! Also the router has a good feature set. (I love features and functionality which is why install 3rd party firmware on all of my routers) The stock firmware covers the basics well in this respect. Printer/USB drive sharing is an easy affair to setup. OpenVPN support is included as well. This is a minor gripe but I wish there was better or more advanced QOS options available like throttling a single IP or mac address and creating QOS tiers and such.Pros-High throughput and fast speeds throughout whether downloading/streaming from the internet or streaming a local network share/usb drive from your network-Wifi load balancing across the 5GHz radios works well and is seamless-Strong 5GHz range (when comparing my older WNDR3700)-Fast wireless transfer speeds to USB drive connected on USB3 port (I averaged 80-90mbps with an attached 3TB Toshiba External using the 5GHz band)-USB Storage sharing works great in conjuction with DDNS. Easy setup to access/share files from anywhere on the net.Cons-Slow router setup/interface. When making changes/applying settings the router will (for the most part) usually require a reboot. When applying settings this can take about 15sec to apply and most times internet/wireless connectivity is interrupted in the process.-Lacking advanced QOS featuresI heavily use 3rd party firmware such as DD-WRT or OpenWRT and one strong feature of it,(at least for the most part) is that a user can configure many aspects of router settings, then save settings in one section and move on and configure the next section and so on. Then when the user is ready to commit the changes, they can select to apply the changes and have the settings be applied and router reset if necessary in one go round.Doing this would greatly speed up the router setup and reduce the many router/connection resets that currently occurs in the setup of the current firmware.Overall ImpressionsAs mentioned before this is a beast of a router! This router is hella fast and the wireless experience, no question is greatly improved from my old router. I have since re-purposed my old WNDR3700 routers as wireless bridges to the R8000 and everything is working great!",

		"reviewText" : "The Omaker M3 is a nice, well designed portable Bluetooth (and can be wired) speaker. It also allows for NFC connection if your phone has this capability.The audio quality is not bad for a portable speaker that is light on price like this one, and one that offers splash proof-ness on top of this. If you are an audiophile, you will once again want to skip this speaker. Frequency response is 100 Hz to 20 KHz. This means you potentially lose a lot of the low end. In practice, the lows from this are good enough, but not deep, thumping if that's your thing. It's acceptable for the portability and being splash proof.Pairing the M3 to my phone was bang on simple, and the added voice prompts let you know exactly what the speaker is doing while pairing or waiting to pair. That is a nice addition.I listened to a variety of music on the speaker, and find more vocal heavy recordings sound pretty close to fantastic. Rock sounds good and rap, well, you miss a lot of the thump with the speaker so I'm not sure you would want the M3 for rap.The speaker includes volume up/down functions and can act as a speaker phone if you so desire. Calls quality is good - better than using the phone itself for sound quality and volume.The manual is serviceable, but as with a lot of these less than expensive Chinese made goods, sold by Chinese companies, there are some issues with the language used. It's not as bad as say, Google Translate from Chinese to English, but it isn't what I would call English from a native speaker. It all makes sense (well, mostly), but it's just not English as we are accustomed. Thankfully you don't really need the manual if you know how to pair BT devices.Recommended.",

It is powered by USB, which means it can be used in a car or at home with any USB port, including the standard inexpensive adapters.  It shows up as a wifi network, which you can connect to on your phone or other device that supports it.  From there, just use it like any other AirPlay or DLNA device.  I have an Android phone, so I downloaded an app.  The audio level can be adjust via the phone.Audio quality is excellent and does not have the tinny compressed sound that comes with Bluetooth.  The audio output is a standard headphone jack, which is also what is normally included in cars.  For use with a home theater receiver, it may require a 3.5 mm to 1/4&#34; or other adapter, depending on the connections available.If you want to upgrade to wireless audio in your car or at home, this little adapter is a good way to do it.Thank you to Sabrent for the review unit.",

		"reviewText" : "The Blurex Wireless-N Outdoor WiFi Rocket is one of the most interesting products that I have reviewed in recent months. This WiFi adapter has such a huge antenna on it that I think you could receive Wii in deep space. The total length of the antenna is about 18 inches long and is about a quarter inch wide at the tip and about an inch and a half wide at the bottom.First of all I want to clarify exactly how you use this adapter for those that may be unsure. I originally thought that this was like the typical WiFi range extender that you hook up and it boost your entire WiFi network. This adapter is connected to your computer and boosts the reception for that computer. It serves a very different purpose than I originally thought it would but it's still very useful, just in a different way. A Wii extender boosts your entire WiFi signal a little bit. This adapter boosts the range on one device very significantly.I have been using this adapter on my gaming laptop that is running Windows 8.1. Installation was a breeze and only took about a minute. It comes with a mini disk and you need to run setup and install the drivers. Once that is done you can plug it in and get started. From my living room my laptop usually has 5 bars and can pick up not only our connection but about ten of our neighbors WiFi signals. When I plug this adapter into my laptop it still has five bars but it can also pick up about 40 different connections around our house. When I take my laptop upstairs my signal is reduced drastically from 5 bars to 1 or 2 bars. My internet speed is greatly reduced upstairs as well. When I plug this adapter into my laptop upstairs it brings my bars back to 5 and my internet speed back to around what it is downstairs.Based on my experience it seems like this adapter will give you 3 or 4 times your normal range. That is very impressive and can come in really handy at times. There are times when we travel and utilize WiFi signals at hotels, airports and various different internet hot spots. These type of connections are notoriously slow and weak. This adapter is a awesome little tool for times like these. It includes a mounting bracket and cable ties if you wish to mount it but I just carry it around. It fits in the front pocket of my laptop bag and can be carried around. The price of this adapter is very reasonable for the quality of the hardware and it's strong performance. I would highly recommend this adapter, especially for the frequent traveler that carries a laptop.Sample provided for review.",

		"reviewText" : "This little device is a circular WiFi receiver with a USB cable attached. The main purpose of this device is to utilize the AirPlay feature that is built-in to apple products like an iPhone or iPad to stream music without wireless. This gives you a better range than Bluetooth technology that is limited to about 25-30 feet. I have many devices that utilize Bluetooth and I like the technology and it's very convenient but after about 20 feet the audio will start to break up. In addition you have to have a Bluetooth compatible device. With this device you can connect it to any device that has a audio jack. That gives you some additional options on what types of devices you can use it on. The only catch is that you have to have the USB receiver plugged into a powered USB port. Unfortunately that limits the possibilities of when and where you can use it. The one way you can get around that is by plugging into a portable battery pack. If you do that then you can take it anywhere.Set up was a breeze you just connect to it like connecting to a new Wifi connection. Once that is done then you simply have to open Pandora or iTunes or whatever music program it is that you use, hit the AirPlay button and select the one that says Sabrent. Then instead of sending the music to your iPhone or iPad internal speaker it will transmit it to your Sabrent WiFi receiver. The sound quality and range is good and so complaints as far as that goes. My only comment is that its just a little more hassle than Bluetooth and most of the newer products are already Bluetooth compatible. This WiFi receiver does exactly what it's supposed to do but I would only suggest it for those that wish to stream music to a device that isn't Bluetooth compatible.Sample provided for review.",

		"reviewText" : "I recently purchased the NETGEAR Nighthawk R8000 X6 router as an upgrade to my old Linksys E3000 router that I have had for almost 4 years.  Needless to say this router is a huge and much needed improvement.  I noticed that on all of my computers, tablets, and smart phones that the internet pages load faster.  Apps that use a lot of bandwidth such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Flixster all load faster and adjust to HD quality streaming way faster than with my old router.  I also noticed that performance remains outstanding even when we are using three demanding apps at the same time (wife and I watching Netflix and Amazon Prime, and the kids watching Netflix on the TV.I have to admit that I was very hesitant to purchase this router after reading a lot of negative reviews of the router's performance, especially with the 5Ghz channels.  I am here to tell you now that with the latest firmware update, these problems are gone.  The first thing I did when I installed the router was update the firmware immediately.  From the first minute I started using the router I have had zero issues.  There have been no problems connecting to the router with my PC (Windows 8.1 Pro), any of my tablets (Apple iPad 4, Amazon Kindle HDX, Samsung Galaxy Tab S), or our smart phones (Samsung Galaxy S5 & Note 3).So without further ado, here are my lists of Pros and Cons:PROs1) Simultaneous Tri-band Wi-Fi works as advertised - no issues with network load when multiple users are online2) Excellent wireless range - the beam forming technology really works well and ensures the strongest signal by adjusting the frequency management accordingly with the surrounding environment3) Build quality of the router is second to none, though it is a bit larger than previous routers that I've owned4) The NETGEAR website is easy to navigate and both software manual and latest firmware are easy to find under the Support section5) The NETGEAR technical support team has surprised a lot of customers by aggressively addressing the early release technical issues this router had and have successfully fixed most if not all of the problems.CONs1) Price is high at $300, but there is currently no competition for this class of WiFi router...yet...Asus will be releasing their next-gen routers soon, so expect NETGEAR to drop the price on the X6 a bit to remain competitive with Asus!2) Does not support next-generation MU-MIMO technology.  There are rumors that NETGEAR may release a firmware update that will allow for MU-MIMO like capability, but don't hold your breath.  This router does not have the necessary hardware to officially support MU-MIMO technology (i.e. Qualcomm QCA 9980 and QCA 9982).Bottom line, if you want an excellent upgrade to your aging 802.11g or 802.11n router, now is the time to jump in and get this awesome router.  You will not be disappointed...unless that is if you have a thin wallet or really 'need' MU-MIMO  :-D",

		"reviewText" : "QUICK SUMMARY:  This Blurex Wifi adapter makes a 2-bar improvement in signal strength when compared to the laptop's internal wifi adapter!  To pull in a weak signal, this adapter really works! 4.5 stars (rounded to 5).BACKGROUND:  To test this adapter, we used a new model Acer laptop in our home's n-network.  Our wifi signal varies depending where you are in our home (or if you're outside our home; we have thick, hurricane impact windows and doors).  When the Acer laptop was receiving a 1-, 2- or 3-bar signal, switching to this Wifi adapter bumped up the signal strength 2 bars!  I don't know the actual dB measure of what a 5-bar meter is on a laptop, but I do know that more bars = stronger signal.  Using this wifi adapter seriously surprised me at what a difference it made.WHAT WE LIKED:- It works!  It noticeably improved the signal reception of our home's wifi signal.  It actually impressed my college son who helped test this antenna for me.- It was a cinch to install under Windows 8.  It was plug-n-play all the way, with no drivers to install.- Windows 8 lets us pick which adapter to use to select to the available networks.WHAT WE WISHED IT HAD:- Our network is dual-band, so we have a 5Ghz band that we typically use.  This antenna only works with the 2.4Ghz.  2.4Ghz has more interference than 5Ghz, which is why we opt for the 5Ghz band.  Also, the 5Ghz band would benefit from an adapter like this, because its range degrades quickly the further you move away from the router.CONCLUSION:  Excellent product if you can deal with the large antenna size and 2.4Ghz band of your n-network!  Vendor supplied product for review.",

I haven't gotten these moist so i don't know how well the sweat proof feature works, but overall these are decent cordless headphones.They come with some extra covers and fins, so they can fit in any ear, and a little case for all of the accessories and the manual.

I have an iMac and iPhone5 and it took a while to setup. 20 mins or so later I was able to view the cam from my iPhone. The picture quality is pretty good and the sound is only O.K. If this platform continues to evolve and get more refined I can image that it will be very good in the future. It is just that as it is now it takes a bit of time to get into the app and select the right camera and see what is going on. The motion and recording features are the best thing about it. But like the competitors out there they charge a monthly subscription fee for this service. I have a liveline and another PTZ camera that I like better for subscription services. I can pan, tilt and zoom on those. This does work really well for monitoring an entry door and getting snapshots via motion detection. The hardware seems good, hopefully the software will be better soon. Not sure how long this camera will function being left on 24/7.

		"reviewText" : "This laptop is pretty good, especially for the price. I'm glad Intel changed the name from Atom to Pentium because of the previous stigma attached to the slow Atom CPUs. The CPU in this one is now an out-of-order design and has competent graphics. The one thing I did do is upgrade to an SSD. This REALLY makes the thing feel much faster. Battery life is phenomenal as well. There are a few little issues. The keyboard is a little 'flexy' when typing, but not unusable by any means. The touchpad will sometimes just not work. I've found that this is the keyboard and touchpad locking software for when the screen is flipped. If you flip the screen over and back, it will fix the touch pad. I've also disabled the built in Synaptics gestures and installed 2-finger-scroll. Its much better and more consistent than the Synaptics control panel. I'm thinking of upgrading to 8GB of RAM, but haven't yet decided as I haven't had any slow down with the workload I put on the machine. Overall, its pretty good, not great. If the touchpad could be fixed, I'd give it 5 stars for sure.As a side note, if Dell offered one of these with a Haswell i3 for $100-150 more, I'd plunk that down without hesitation. I'm not looking for an i7 quadcore or anything, but just not a 'budget' machine. However, until laptop OEMs realize that small doesn't need to be low end or ultra high end, I'll be fine with this one.",

It has 4 ports that total 6.8A (two 2.4A and two 1.0A), but also has an output of 6.8A. That means unlike other wall chargers, you can actually charge 4 devices at once.2. Also unlike other wall chargers, there is no electrical cord. Although this has a figure 8 AC input opening as is common on some chargers, there is no electrical cord with a plug on the end that goes into it. Instead this unit cleverly has an AC plug that fits right in. While the prongs on that plug don't fold for travel, that's unnecessary because it takes just a second to remove the plug.This design has pros and cons. The pro is that there is no need to bring an electrical cord when you travel. The con is that it's not always convenient to plug a wall charger plug directly into a wall outlet or a power strip as opposed to using an electrical cord that gives you more freedom about where to place the wall charger and hogs less outlets. Of course you can use an extension cord for this unit, but then that defeats the convenience of a unit that doesn't require you to bring an electrical cord. It's all a matter of personal preference and something to be aware of. I bring extension cords with multiple outlets when I travel anyhow, so I'll just plug this into one of those outlets. I'm glad this doesn't have its own electrical cord, which is superfluous for me.Note: Although the directions say there are three other plugs available for international travel, there is no mention how to obtain them.Bottom line: Wall chargers are becoming more powerful and compact.

I have some media-card hubs (like in my Dell monitors) where the card has to be inserted deeply into the slot, and if the spring loaded eject mechanism doesn't work, you need pliers to pull the card out-- not fun.I really like the short captive cable and ability to store one card of each kind inside the lid (a nice place to keep spares). And that the unit is powered by the USB bus, no additional power cable needed. There's a small blue LED signaling both power and activity.I tried the reader out (so far) on Windows 7 (USB3), MacOS (USB3) and FreeBSD (USB2) using a Transcend 16GB SDHC. On both FreeBSD and Win7, I got steady 14.5MB/s write speeds (likely bound by the card, rather than the reader). MacOS on a 2013 Macbook Pro was mysteriously much slower, but I didn't have a chance to diagnose why.[ A sample was provided to me for review. ]This sort of card-reader is useful to anybody with multiple portable gadgets-- sooner or later you'll need to get data off a device that's broken, or when the battery is dead, or want to do a 32GB transfer and not wait for USB2 on your device, or maybe the cable is missing, or you need to zero out the memory card before giving it away... for all of those scenarios, a card reader like this one is very useful.

		"reviewText" : "This audio receiver provides a novel approach to wireless audio transmission, using WiFi rather than bluetooth. This item plugs in to any USB outlet for its power source. Once plugged in it can be linked to a wireless audio transmission source such as an iPad/iPhone or Android phone/tablet.  For this connection to be made you need to go into your phone/tablet WiFi settings and choose the Sabrent device from the available WiFi connections that appear. Then, you can use DLNA or Airplay supporting apps to play the audio and the audio should stream wirelessly to the receiver, which will play the sound through a headphone or speaker that you connect to the 3.5 mm output jack on the Sabrent receiver. When I tested this following the included instructions it worked smoothly. The sound quality is very good, better than bluetooth since the WiFi doesn't compress the audio. The drawback is that you can't have your device connected to any Internet WiFi source while it's connecting to the WiFi audio receiver. This item is also limited by the USB only power and the short length of the USB cable that folds in to the receiver. This could be used in your home as well as in a car where the vehicle has a 3.5mm auxiliary audio input jack and a USB plugin. This is a nice alternative to have available for wireless audio transmission from select devices. This receiver has red and blue LED indicator lights to show the presence of the WiFi connection and the audio transmission. Perhaps in the future this will be upgraded to offer more options, such as supporting other devices and offering a bluetooth connection for streaming audio from a webstream. It currently comes with a 1 year warranty and tech support in case you have trouble setting it up. I received a free item from the manufacturer for review purposes.",

		"reviewText" : "This USB hub has 4 ports on it so you can expand how many devices you can connect to your computer. Most desktop computers have multiple ports but some laptops or notebook computers only have 1 or 2 ports on it. With this hub you can connect all your favorite devices like a wireless mouse, wireless keyboard, wireless numeric keypad and wireless speakers to name a few. If you computer doesn't have a built-in wireless adapter or Bluetooth functionality then you make have a USB dongle for those as well. Needless to say that all these toys utilize USB so you need enough ports to support them.Some important things to note about this USB hub is that it's plug and play and only takes a few seconds to get working with it. It has worked perfectly for me since I started using it. It supports USB 2.0 but not the most recent USB 3.0 technology. If you transfer a lot of files to a external hard drive then you will notice the slower speed but not when connecting a mouse or any other similar devices like that. The average user probably wouldn't notice.The really cool thing about this USB hub is it's incredibly small size. If you take it on the road with you then you will appreciate the micro size of this hub. It's by far the smallest USB hub that I have ever seen and can easily fit into any pocket. For that reason this HUB has earned a well deserved 5 stars and I would highly recommend it to someone that takes a HUB with them outside of the house.Sample provided for review.",

		"reviewText" : "Great fidelity.  Some issues I didn't expect (reason for 4 stars) but I'm keeping it.My 2011 Nissan has no A2DP Bluetooth stereo audio.  Nissan only provided cellphone Bluetooth.  So I needed a unit that could send transmitted stereo signal from my cellphone to a receiver that would distribute the music or audio stream to the &#34;aux&#34; input within my car.  This unit does that well with great fidelity.  However...I do NOT like the fact that I have to dig down into the center console each and every time I want to re-pair my phone with the unit.  Unlike built-in car manufacturer supplied A2DP stereo Bluetooth, which repairs automatically every time you start your car, this unit does not do it automatically.Why didn't I get BT audio installed when I bought the car new?  Nissan wanted THOUSANDS more for the navigation system I didn't need to which they tied the A2DP feature.  They would not provide A2DP unless I paid nearly $500.00 for it as an after-market item. So you have your choice...buy this with a slight loss of pairing convenience,or spend $500 on a car dealers profit.For a unit obviously mass manufactured in China, I am astonished at the frequency response (really flat as BT units go) and overall fidelity of vocals and instrumentation.Another thing....this unit also provides cellphone Bluetooth in addition to A2DP media Bluetooth.  And the microphone is on the small body of the unit. So whomever you call or calls you will not be able to hear you well if your aux jack is in the center console.  Too bad it doesn't pick up your voice from the cellphone's condenser microphone.",

If you want USB 3 speeds, you MUST plug this into a USB 3 capable port. If you plug into a USB 2 port it will still function, however it will only run at USB 2 speeds for all devices.That being said, the majority of memory cards I have tap out in terms of speed whether I am using the internal card reader on my XPS 8500 or this external reader. In this case, the card reader speed is not the constraint, my memory cards are.The reader is quite light and us easily portable. I use it with my Surface Pro 3 now to add the ability to copy files from my camera's memory cards to my Surface Pro 3. It works beautifully.I don't like the packaging, as it is that nasty clam shell plastic that's difficult to open. I don't know why Sabrent chooses this packing as it's really geared towards anti-theft. Since Sabrent really only sells on-line that I can see, I don't think theft is an issue.Despite the packaging, this card reader is a great deal. It offers multiple card options (SD/MMC, MicroSD and CF) and is highly portable.Recommended.I received a free sample for review purposes from Sabrent.",

This requires much more effort. I like things as simple as possible.2. I use a wireless bluetooth receiver connected to the AUX port in my car. That receiver has an internal battery that will last about 12 hours, so I don't have to keep it connected to a USB port. No USB power source is required (except when I need to recharge it), as is true of this product. One less piece of equipment.3. Bluetooth works on a wide variety of devices while Airplay is proprietary to Apple. I have my share of Apple devices--iPhone, iPad, Macbook and Apple TV so I am very familiar with it. One of the main &#34;selling points&#34; of Airplay is lossless audio. Without getting into the technical differences between Airplay and Bluetooth, let me say that unless you're talking about something like a home theatre system, as a practical matter I don't think there's a perceptible difference in the sound. One review says that bluetooth is &#34;tinny&#34;--but not on my car stereo system or on a host of wireless bluetooth speakers that I use.Bottom line: This works, but for me is not any better than a bluetooth receiver, which is a lot simpler and easier to use, and also works effortlessly on non Apple devices without having to download any extra apps.",

However, installation was so very simple. I just plugged in the Harmony Hub and connected one of the USB receivers to the back of my Smart TV. I instantly had control of all the functions on the television through this one device. Prior to using this keyboard I had a hand held remote that I would use to surf the internet on the TV.  I found it annoying to have to type in words one letter at a time. With this device, not only can I easily type in the name of the movie or the song  that I'm looking for, I can get on Google Docs, and  write books or anything I need to do.  Being a writer I liked that feature. It's nice to lay on the bed and let my writing skills go wild.I did not hook up Direct TV, even though you can, because I like having a separate remote for that. I did hook up my DVD player, and was able to watch movies at the push of a button. I found the mouse pad on the keyboard easier to control than the remote mouse. One important revelation with this product.  I never have to worry about losing the remote control again. The Technology is amazing.",

My distance inside my house on the first test is abysmal, if I place my EVO 4G LTE more than 3 feet away it loses the connection. I haven't tried it on my boat yet though and will update this comment if my opinion changes once this is tested outside. I say this because my house likely has a ton of RF interference. My house is pretty much a wireless freak zone ranging from wireless phones to dual band routers. Other likely culprits may include my Logitech wireless keyboard and mouse and wireless surround sound speakers. My walls are not wireless friendly either... That said though I have a Ion Rock Blocker wireless that get's about twenty to thirty feet of range even between walls. It does also sit pretty close to the speakers in the cooler, so another likely culprit could be the magnets are poorly shielded and thus interfering with the adapter.Once I get this out in the inter-coastal/bay this Saturday where there's less wireless signals bouncing around I'll update the comment if things change.That said as far as sound quality when in range, it's pretty impressive. I really hope I can walk around my boat with out signal drops. If drops happen on the water it's back to the drawing board for my wireless solution.",

The main thing with the Raspberry Pi was being able to use my tv as I had used the WebTV.

This Logitech reminds me of the WebTV wireless keyboards but with a touchpad added. I will no longer have an excuse not to get my project underway now! Meanwhile, it is serving as a remote control for my tv and dvd player. I like the feel of the keys. As I progress, I'll update this review.

		"reviewText" : "There is an old adage that says \"Don't judge a book by its cover.\" I agree with this sentiment, however, packaging can tell a lot about the product inside. If a company takes times to create a packaging solution that makes you take notice, I assume they will take pride in making sure their product functions very well. When you open both the HEOS 3 & 5, you can tell immediately that Denon took the time to create a great package for their speakers. Upon opening the speaker box, you are greeted by a smaller box that contains a foam insert that cradles the power cable, an audio cable and an Ethernet cable. There is also another foam piece that contains a quick start guide. Underneath these items you will find the speaker. Seems trivial, but it does show attention to detail. The packaging is very Apple-like.Setup is a snap. The first thing you need to do is to download the HEOS app. I set mine up using iOS. Opening the app leads you through an illustrated set up procedure that guides you to adding your speaker to your network. You will use the provided audio cable to assist you in this process. You provide the password to your network and voil&agrave;, your speaker is now ready to use. (There was an update that needed to be done after I set up the speaker. It took three tries before the update took. You will not be able to group speakers until both updates are performed) I then selected a button on the bottom of the screen that allowed me to group the two speakers together. You can name them whatever you want to help you to identify them. All you need to do is drag one speaker on top of the other and they will now play together. You drag them apart if you want them to play separately.Okay, packaging and set up were good, but spending this much on speakers you expect good sound and ease of use. Let's see how the HEOS stacks up.You first have to set up a HEOS account. Under the Music tab you can select Pandora, Spotify, tunein, Rhapsody, or music from your iOS device. You can also play files from a USB drive. A big omission and disappointment here is the lack of AirPlay. I would like the ability to stream audio from any app that I'm using. Hopefully this will be added in a future update.I am not a hard core audiophile, but both the HEOS 3 & 5 pump out great sound. I found the bass on both speakers enough to rattle your windows. The larger 5 doing a little better. I have had larger wireless speakers that did not sound as good as these new offerings from DENON. There is an equalizer setting (Settings-My Devices-EQ) that you allows you to control bass and treble for each speaker. The app allows you to control each speaker volume separately or together. You can only control the volume within the app. I found this a bit annoying. There was also a slight lag after you adjusted the volume before the speakers responded.The HEOS 5 is the larger of the two speakers. I put this on top of a cabinet in my kitchen and it fills the room completely with sound. A LED on the bottom of the speaker lets you know is it on and properly connected (blue). It flashes yellow when it is connecting to the network or if there is a problem with your connection. Its smaller sibling, the HEOS 3, can be used vertically or horizontally. Make sure you select your orientation in the settings. I put this one in my living room vertically. It also has a blue light on the bottom (vertically) of the speaker.Other wireless speakers (both Bluetooth and network based) I have had would drop the connections periodically or I would need to enter the setup process all over again. The HEOS speakers have been rock solid with their connections. I have the HEOS 5 on a switch in the kitchen and it connects itself within a minute of flipping the switch.Overall, these speakers would be a great addition to anyone's home. It is cool to have your tunes in one room and go to another room and have the sound follow you! The only downside is the HEOS app. It is not quite ready for primetime and until AirPlay is added it will cost these speakers a star. Until then, I will be enjoying music from the best decade, the 80s! Shot through the heart.....",

(That means that I don't have a little USB dongle on my laptop to boast single.)  Specifically, my download speed is over 55 and my upload is over 12 (Mbps).  Now your area may have greater or less speed than mine but my AT THE PLUG speed on ethernet is less than 5% higher tested in realtime.So, to tell you the truth.  I have always hated Netgear.  When a client put in one of their low end routers months ago, I groaned.  Now, I'm here to say the R8000 (AKA AC3200) - JUST SCREAMS.  And it is equally MAC friendly, has a nice iphone app and serves as an iTunes server.I think it will be a while before anything beats this.  Wow.  (Again, from the time FedEx dropped the box until the period in this sentence hit was barely an hour - it's that easy.)",

It took a long time to install because it kept finding other routers already on my network that weren't there but I decided to wait it out and it did get installed.  The major problem was the fact that it kept dropping the internet connection.  It would reconnect but with all the different devices I have on my network the interruptions were REALLY annoying.  A second disappointment was the fact that the highly touted range was no better than my old Netgear R6300 router which I'm going back to.",

		"reviewText" : "The image quality of this camera is quite good.  I was looking forward to using this camera to monitor my carport where my car and front door is.  However, there are several issues which makes it almost impossible to use as a motion detector outdoors.  First, you cannot tell the software to exclude certain portions of the image from motion detection, so you can only monitor an area without anything that can move in the wind, such as trees and bushes otherwise you get hundreds of useless video clips.  I am using this camera behind glass, so I cannot use the night vision feature because the lights shine back in the reflection in the glass.  No big deal, since my carport is lit at night.  But after mounting the camera in a place where there were no trees in the image and turning off the night vision lights, the camera was still detecting motion the whole night because the camera constantly tries to adjust to low lighting conditions, so it detects the brightness adjustments that it applies as motion... again, resulting in hundreds of useless clips throughout the night.So, using this camera for outdoor viewing is difficult.  Indoor use is preferred and works a lot better.  Live image quality on my phone and on the website looks great and works surprisingly well.  I really wish this camera did not require premium subscription services for the most useful features though.  There is no reason this camera shouldn't be able to save clips to a location on your network, since it is already connected to it via WiFi.  Also, it would have been a lot better if Belkin allowed you to use Google Drive or Dropbox for storage instead of requiring a separate subscription from Belkin.  As of the time of my review, I haven't even been able to find anything about pricing after the 30-day trial has ended.If you plan on using this camera indoors to monitor video and audio and don't mind a subscription fee, this camera is an excellent choice.  Otherwise, I would consider alternatives.",

I am happy to report that the Blurex High Power 1000Mw Wireless-N Wifi Adapter fixed this. While my laptop's wifi card just doesn't have the power to connect to the internet, this Blurex Wifi adapter gives me close to 100 percent power. This wifi adapter comes with a long usb cord, so, if you can't quite get a wifi connection in your corner of the house, you can always place the adapter closer to the source. I had to do this for my connection; while I was unable to get a fast connection in my room, placing the adapter just outside the door to my room worked perfectly. Finally, this adapter can be affixed to a wall with supplied hardware. Getting internet connectivity has been a real problem in my house, now it is not. I highly recommend this adapter to this in a similar situation. Note: I received this adaptor for free in exchange for a review.",

		"reviewText" : "I'll refrain from reciting the specs and also disclose that I was unable to measure the actual transfer speeds of my review sample using USB 3.0. The reason for that is I did test it using a 8GB thumb drive and an OTG connector to my Galaxy Note 3 phone, but 8GB was not a sufficiently large transfer to accurately time.What I did do is plug it into my old ThinkPad T61 running Windows XP and mounted some of my old memory cards. I could read all of them and that is one of the reasons why I rated this reader so highly. Another reason is the size. It easily fits in a shirt pocket and has a short, flat pigtail with USB that fold under and snaps into the casing.Another thing I love is all of the slots are precision fit. Bit the final thing that won me over and inspired me to give it five stars is the top lid opens with cutouts for CF, SD/MMC and micro SD card storage.Although the product specs only mention that this is backward compatible with USB 2.0, it is also compatible with 1.1 compliant devices. That means that it will work on most legacy devices with the most common legacy cards.If you have a large collection of older card media from cameras, phones and other devices this is an inexpensive way to transfer the files to a computer for further back-up.",

		"reviewText" : "Yes !!!!!!! USD 300 seems to be a very big amount for router when you can get most of them at about 40-60 bucks and your friends will swear they work really good and they get very good internet speed with their cheaper routers. They will drag you to buy the cheaper one and get stuck with the Internet speed.BUT DO NOT FALL IN TO THIS TRAP !!!! Get the best router in the market !!!I went against all my friend's suggestions and decoded to get the Nighthawk X6 from Netgear a few weeks back. I would say this is the best router till date. It has so many revolutionary features, which will change the definition of router forever, not to mention the internet speed it provides with its two frequencies and three channels in total. I can assure all you future customers that you wont regret spending your hard earned money on this router.  This router is worth every penny of its price.I liked it so much that I have stopped using my Apple Airport time machine (which I had bought a few months back to use as a router and a backup hard drive for my MacBook pro). It now works as a backup device only. The router has two USB ports and now I can connect another hard drive to it to keep have my collection of movies always available to me, not on my computer's hard drive but readily available when ever I need them.A few of the features of the router, which I love:1. A tri-band WiFi, two of them working at 5GHz give you the fastest internet service, ideal for gaming and online streaming2. S3. One of my favorite feature is the programmable guest network (which can be with or without password) and the best thing is you can program it for a specific duration after which it will be disabled automatically).4. You can access your home network from your office location using a VPN facility-the ultimate requirement in today's era !!5. WiFi signal has implicit and explicit beam forming of signal so that the device being used gets the maximum of the bandwidth of Wi-Fi, thus improving speed further6. Two USB pots, one of them USB3.0 make the data access superfast from the connected devices.7. Included software application \"Genie\" is actually a genie in all senses. You can control your internet using this, update the software, change passwords, activate/inactivate guest access, apply parental controls, and many more (you can even see what deceives are connected to your WiFi ;)8. 8 Sixe external antennas, which were introduced in previous model and increased in number in this one, increase the signal strength manifold in almost all parts of your home.9. ReadySHARE Vault helps you backup your Windows machine without even you noticing it.A few minor things I didn't like but I am sure they wont hold anyone from buying this gem of a device:1. It occupies a relatively larger space on ground (can't be kept upright) but you can circumvent this by hanging it on a wall)2. The switches on the front are a little difficult to push3. Antennas seems a little fragile (but they wont break until you are in a mood to literally wrestle with the device or you are angry because your favorite team lost the match and you can't blame anyone else !!!).With all said and written, I would say Nighthawk X6 is a next-generation router stuffed with a plethora of unbelievably pleasant features which will amuse gamers and others alike !!! Do not let the price be a hindrance in you getting the best internet speed around your house!!!Go for it !!!EDIT/DISCLAIMER (July 09, 2014):A few people have revised the question that how could I use it for weeks when it was released a day back. Well, I would like to make it clear that I was invited as a beta tester for this router even before it was released in market. I had already used it for a month. But in the hindsight, I would have bought it even if I had not used it earlier.I would suggest you that if you are serious about buying a quality high performance router, get it from Amazon, use for a few weeks and return it if you do not like (and I am sure it will never come to that !!!). Also, I declare that I am not affiliated to Netgear nor did I get any compensation/favors from Netgear for this review.",

		"reviewText" : "The Omaker M3 is a compact square shaped Bluetooth enabled external speaker, that delivers decent sound quality, for a unit with just a single speaker.  It's most notable feature might be that it is water resistant, and because of its square shape and flat sides, is very stable, and not easily tipped over.Like most external speakers, this device can be connected via Bluetooth, or hard wired using a standard 1/8\" audio cord.  A micro-USB port for recharging, and a line in jack, reside behind a removable rubber strip.  Powered by rechargeable batteries, the rated life of the speakers is eight hours.Controls are elementary, consisting of four buttons.  Besides the power button, a second button raises the volume, while a third lowers it.  When linked to your phone, a fourth button allows you to take a call.  Covered by rubber panels, the buttons are a little difficult to operate, and you sometimes have to press them very hard.  The symbols on them are a bit hard to make out, so I used a marker pen to fill in the depressions on the symbols.Lightweight and easy to direct sound where you want it, this speaker produces a decent level of sound without distorting too much, but it just isn't capable of providing sound for a large space.  If you're looking for a speaker that delivers high volumes, this is not it.When turned on, the speaker quickly connects with any Bluetooth device that it has been previously paired with.  The unit has a number of prerecorded audible notifications, spoken by a female voice with a slight Asian accent.  They include \"Waiting for a Bluetooth connection\", and \"Bluetooth successfully connected\".  This quirky feature is something that other external speakers manufactured in Asia have.The people at Omaker provided a sample for evaluation.  Being weather resistant, having a low profile, and being compact and easy to carry, are probably this speaker's strongest attributes.  Acessories include an audio patch cord, micro-USB cord, and a detachable lanyard.",

My son has recently gotten into jogging, and before we ever got the chance to review these, commented that the wires for his headphones constantly bugged him during his runs.  He was thrilled to try these.  They are terrific!  We very easily connected to all Bluetooth phones we tried and got a wonderfully clear sound.  They changed quickly and stay charged longer than even advertised.  It charges with a micro-USB, the same thing that non-Apple phones use.These came with three different buds and two different &#34;fins&#34;.  This was great for two different people using these, and also because it took trying a few to find the one that my son liked.All the buttons on these worked well, so you can do things like pause the music to answer calls or go to the next song in your list easily.  The microphone that is built-in worked well.  These even worked for answering Skype voice calls!  The range in the Bluetooth is good.  We tested it at up to 30 feet.Overall, these met our expectations.  A very cool concept, done well!",

Now, I can leave my iPhone over by my bag 30 feet away and not have to mess with falling out of shorts pockets every time I lay down to do an exercise. I forget what the range of these earbuds are(I think it's about 35 ft.) once it's been synced, but even if you're going further than that and you don't want to keep your phone on you all you have to do is lay it down wherever you're going to be exercising.I had no issues syncing my iPhone to these earbuds. They are pretty much a perfect fit for my ears and rather comfortable. Most of the time I don't even know they are in there. Once I have these in my ears I tuck the short cord down the front of my shirt and no more cords in the way. Occasionally I will have to pull the cord up(or reach under my shirt) to adjust the volume. They say these are water resistant and I would say I believe that. I do high intensity 2 hour workouts 4-5 days a week and I'm usually drenched in sweat mid-way through the workout, so considering these cords are planted next to my torso the entire time, being soaked in sweat, I'd say they hold up well to water.The earbuds stay in my ears for the entire duration of my workout without coming out at all. My main gripes(which are small) with these Outdoor Tech Wireless Earbuds is the sound quality and the charge. The sound quality is not bad. In fact, the highs are quite good. But I thought the bass was a bit lacking. The charge is supposed to last 6 hours and that seems a bit off to me because after 5 hours of use they die on me. It is a bit annoying to someone like me, who is a gym rat, to have to charge these every 2 days or so. Fortunately, they recharge in about an hour.Overall, though you can't go wrong with these Outdoor Tech earbuds. They are durable and the sound is solid overall. But best of all is they are ingenious: No more unsightly, annoying wires in your way and no more carrying the phone around in your pocket. I actually hate bringing a phone in the gym, unless I'm going to leave it over by my bag and leave it alone, because if I carry it around with me in my hand or pocket I always want to play around with it, which negates my workout at times.

The sensor itself is quite good, and the still frames from this camera are outstanding.The audio is next to useless, unfortunately, and has constant clicking artifacts, which I assume is the WiFi signal interfering with the poorly designed audio circuitry.To do any motion detection or clip recording--that is, to do anything very useful with this camera--requires a monthly subscription. Furthermore, the motion detection is very poorly engineered, and can't do regions of interest, and I have yet to find a setting which doesn't just trigger dozens of useless movie clips every day just because wind moved a tree.The iOS app is horribly engineered. It constantly hangs, can't record video at anything other than a few frames per second, often produces video that has errors so that the iPhone can't play it back, and forces you to watch a few second animation of Belkin's stupid logo every single bloody time you start it up.Perhaps worst of all: there is no way to operate this camera purely over a LAN. Even if you don't want to use the cloud features, this camera will be in constant communication with Belkin's servers to \"punch a hole\" in your firewall and allow external communication to the device. If they wanted to, anybody at the company Belkin outsources the web application to could view your camera, any time it's powered up. More importantly, anybody that hacked their servers could do so, too. Lord knows what they could do from the camera, since it's basically a small computer in its own right. A good hacker could probably reverse engineer the firmware and reprogram the camera to attack your network from inside your firewall. Basically, this camera is a computer on your local network behind your firewall that a company you shouldn't trust now has permanent access to. I'm not really happy about that. You should be able to turn off the ability for the camera to be reachable by the world beyond your firewall, but that's not possible. As such, this is about the least secure camera you can buy. Is it worse than a drop cam in terms of security? I don't think so, but I wouldn't recommend one of those either. I would recommend a camera that allows you to operate entirely within your LAN, such as a FOSCAM.I've been really disappointed with Belkin's products recently. They seem to be trying to make money off subscriptions, but are forgetting to deliver a quality product off of which to to base them. I don't appreciate being forced into a subscription just to do things that shouldn't require the cloud. As an option, fine, but this product is useless without the cloud, paid or otherwise. What happens when Belkin decides to write off this product, as they did with their terrible baby monitors? How long will they continue to support the servers for this? Without their servers, this device is just a door stop.",

It is really bad at displaying motion.  But the farther away the motion is the better it works.  So shooting outside through a window at toward the barnyard works well.

This has been my go to device to stream music and have a aftermarket hands free device in my car. I works very well in this aspect. Since this device is really small, super light, and the metal audio adapter allow it to mount directly to my head unit. It fits perfectly, and is a minimal eye soar. The device pics up my voice with no problem, and streams my music/calls pefectly.2. I have also used this as a wireless headphone device. I had a really long day out on the train/public transportation, and towards the end of the day my phone was dying. I was able to put my phone in my bad and allow it to charge off of my battery pack.3. Finally I have brought this in the house and streamed my music through my home stereo, and it performed just as well as it did in the car! The range is not huge, but for the size of the device, and the low power that it runs off of, I think the range is absolutely acceptable.The battery has to be tiny on this thing! It is so small, and I have yet to run it flat. I charge it regularly in the car where it is always attached to power, but I have had it running for a full 7 hour stint of yard work last weekend, and it rocked through all of it!",

		"reviewText" : "Very disappointed with the Nighthawk X6 so far. Wireless range through walls isn't boosted noticeably compared to the prior Netgear router I was using, the Netgear N600. Administration interface is consistent with the N600. The X6 definitely looks cool, but aside from looks, I'm not seeing much here to say that it's worth $300.Even worse, while attempting to download files via Sabnzbd (a file download manager), if I allow the application to download without limitation, it typically maxes out my internet connection (50mbps or ~5-6MB/s). On my N600, this behavior was handled just fine. On the X6, though, the router will consistently stop functioning completely after a matter of minutes of full connection usage. What's ridiculous about this, is that it's not like I have an amazing internet connection that the router can't handle. This router is supposed to be able to handle gigabit connections, yet it can't even handle 50 megabit...  Once the router fails to function, I can't even access the router control panel, as the network is completely non-functional. The only resolution is to restart the router. This has occurred every time that I've sustained max bandwidth on my internet connection for (at least) several minutes.I'm returning the existing unit to Amazon for a replacement, and I'll give it one more shot. If the replacement has the same behavior, I'll be getting a refund.And just a note, I did contact Netgear support about this issue. Live Chat was useless, as it kept me \"on hold\" waiting for a CSR for ~30 minutes, then told me no one was available. I then called in, got a call center in India apparently (or at least that region). The CSR had poor english, I had to explain the situation multiple times. He had me reset the router settings (which I did), and afterwards, the problem persisted (as expected). His recommendation was an RMA or return to store, for which obviously returning to Amazon is the better option, since Amazon should send me a replacement before I have to send back the original unit.UPDATE (7/22):I've received a replacement for the Nighthawk X6, from Amazon. I installed the replacement, restored my prior unit's settings to the new unit.I then rebooted my computers (to start fresh), and then started up Sabnzbd on my tower PC.That PC is running wired ethernet to the router. Any other computer on the network is using wifi.With Sabnzbd running, I started up multiple file downloads, each with multiple connections per file, and configured Sabnzbd to download without any limitations (meaning, it was able to use the full capacity of my ISP connection). My internet connection is a home connection that maxes out around 55mbps (around 5-6MB/s). Once Sabnzbd surpassed 4.5MB/s, any other open connections on the network shut down/disconnected (video conference stream, voip audio connection).Additionally, any pages that I attempted to visit or view, any domains I attempted to ping, etc, all failed.I attempted to view various web services that I have enabled on other local network computers, none were accessible. I also attempted to view the router administration page, again it was not accessible.This is entire unacceptable. While my internet connection may be at full capacity, which would understandably cause too much congestion for other data feeds to run consistently over my WAN connection, the fact that the entire network is brought to a standstill (non-functional) suggests something is completely wrong with the router.This has occurred across two pieces of hardware, which suggests to me that the software is where the issue lies (or else there is a solid flaw in the hardware).My usage of the router is exactly how I used the previous router that I had installed, the Netgear N600, which worked flawlessly in this regard (I replaced that router as it's performance started to degrade recently, after ~2 yrs of ownership).I've contacted Netgear as they've requested, with the above updated info. Ball is in their court now.UPDATE (7/23): Netgear support was pretty much non-existent. Sure, it's easy to get a level-1 CSR that spouts the same generic troubleshooting steps, but good luck getting anyone that understands what they're actually trying to troubleshoot.In my own testing, running Sabnzbd with ~60 open connections at ~3MB/s is stable-ish on the R8000, but once the download speed is increased to ~3.5-5MB/s, the network becomes unusable to other machines. There are no log events that would suggest a firewall rule is being triggered (such as NAT filtering, DOS, etc). It seems the router is simply unable to cope with this type of traffic.I'm sending the router back to Amazon for a refund, and will revert to using my old Netgear N600 until I get an alternative router, likely the high-end option from ASUS, as I've heard good things about that brand of router.",

		"reviewText" : "We have the Heos 3 and the Heos 5 systems. Aside from audio quality, the setup and experience is the same. I'll start with audio quality, then the rest of the review will cover using the system, which should be the same over both speakers.The Heos 3 and 5 both have quite desirable sound quality. The 5 seems to have more base and sound travels out both sides of the speaker, while the 3 only sends sound in one direction. I'd recommend the 5 for a central sound device and the 3 for a corner. Both these speakers pack quite a punch for their size. I don't have a reference point for their sound compared to speakers with similar prices.Setup is reasonably simple. Just install the Heos app on your Android (what we did) or iDevice and hook up to the speaker via the provided AUX cable and your headphone jack on the device. Just follow the instructions and have your wifi password ready. I had no troubles doing this. I'd recommend looking for updates, as both the speakers we got had them available.The main issue I have with these speakers is the app and available sources of music. Our music is all in Google Music, and this is not available at this time. Nor is Amazon music. There is however, hope for more support later, as well as the current apps, such as Pandora (which we also use), Rhapsody, TuneIn, and Spotify. It's a bit clunky to use, however. You have to first create a Heos account, then log into your other accounts. This will allow, at least, you to use any Heos app you log into on any device without having to log into your other accounts every time (I'm fairly certain at least).What no one needs is another ecosystem to have to mess with. What would be really nice would be the ability to have an app that would stream sound from any app to the speakers. It's a bit unfortunate the speaker access is limited in this way. However, there are some good things about the app and the speakers.You can play music stored locally on the tablet or device. It only looks in the Music folder, so if you have music elsewhere, you can't just grab it, you have to move it (as far as Android is concerned, at least.) You don't need to mess with the Heos account for this. Also, from Windows 7 or 8 you can right click any folder  and select Play To and choose any of the speakers to send music in that folder to. Then, using the app, you can group speakers and play to multiple Heos speakers. You can also send single files, or add more to the playlist. We've not yet tested streaming saved playlists, so this may also be an option. When I try to access network files, I cannot stream them. I do not know the cause of this limitation.You can also hook an AUX cable into the speaker and play anything into the speaker, and propagate the sound out to other speakers in the same way as above. This may not be ideal for playing TV or movies, since it buffers, and might not be in sync to the screen.From the app you can adjust volume, the bass and treble EQ, name and rename the speakers from a preset list (Bedroom, Living Room, etc) or choose any arbitrary name you desire.On each speaker you can mute them (this will not pause the audio) and adjust volume.If you are already within the provided ecosystems then you will have better access to your music. As it is, we can only access what we have available on our Android devices and what is on our PCs (and even then that is limited. Using a Media server may fix that, but I don't have one set up to try it).The speakers sound great and just needs to use a more open platform to connect to them. We've experimented, but haven't figured out a better solution yet. We can recommend them for the great sound they will push across your wirelessly connected home, but with some hesitancy over the limited access you may have to your music.",

		"reviewText" : "The Sound Blaster Roar is one of the most perfectly designed portable Bluetooth speaker system with so many extras, it tough to know where to begin. Creative has included so many cool extra functions I realized that I'll never have to have another portable stereo Bluetooth speaker again.These are some of the features that just blew me away.It pairs quickly with the push of a button.The sound is perfect. Absolutely. When I did maximize my phones volume and the Sound Blaster Roar, there was a bit of distortion, but I find this to be a good feature. It gives you the limit of its sound capability - and it is high. There are five drivers powered by two completely separate amplifiers! The bass is very strong and distinct with a built-in subwoofer. The bass comes out the sides and top, the mid-range shouts from the top along with some treble and the highs/treble comes out through two stereo speakers in the front. There is the &#34;ROAR&#34; button which is a booster. Your highs really become pronounced and the bass is slightly louder. The increase in clarity is what really stood out. It's almost overkill.It also works as a speakerphone, which is not unusual but the sound is perfect.There is a miscroSD card slot to store music and it can play MP3, WAV and WMA files. You can probably actually store more music on the card than on your Bluetooth device (32 GB). You can plug this into your PC directly and connect it over the USB and work it as a digital-to-analog converter (DAC). You can play music and charge it at the same time, saving battery power.There is a USB port that will charge a Smartphone, but this drains battery power, unless your unit is plugged into a power source. Easy enough!There is a siren/alarm that is activated by switching the speaker to the &#34;ARM&#34; control. This is part of the overkill, but someone will love this.There is a microphone if you want to record conversations or music/podcasts. To be honest, the sound recording quality of music is not that great, but calls come through great.The &#34;Roar&#34; is like a brick in size (2.2&#34; X 7.9&#34; X 4.5&#34;) and has a high-tech design of black and silver grills with easy to see and use buttons. It weighs about 2.5 pounds but there is a carrying pouch that wraps tightly around it so you don't have to remove it to enjoy sound/music (not included).The functions buttons are all on the top including, Power, Bluetooth/Call Answer/End, Volume Up/Down, and the powerful Roar mode. There is also a three-LED battery indicator light (small green lights) and lights for the Bluetooth and Roar mode.Around the back of the unit gives you a power port for a 3.5mm AUX input (adapter included). This is where the USB port exists for charging and the built-in 6,000mAh battery. This gives you up to eight hours of music, but if you play the Sound Blaster loudly, you will use the power up more quickly. Also, 6,000mAh alone will charge an average Smartphone about 2.5-3 times, so plug it in while charging your smartphone. There is also a small Play/Pause and Forward/Back buttons for songs along with a Record button and a microphone mute for sound recording. Did I mention the Loud Sounds switch, the Alarm arming switch or the Alarm button? It really is a welcome assortment of overkill.If you are going to spend the money for the Sound Blaster Roar, you will get your money's worth. The amount of functions and the audio performance are so well designed and constructed, I don't think anything else is out there that comes close. I am really impressed with this device. It's about time a company designed and produced a great multi-function Bluetooth speaker system that is actually affordable and worth every penny!Product supplied for a fair and honest review.",

		"reviewText" : "I have a similar set of speakers to compare these to: theCyber Acoustics Subwoofer Satellite System (CA-3602a), which is roughly in the same price range.These budget Logitech speakers don't sound as good. The subwoofer isn't as substantial, and these sound a bit less clear. I think the acoustic term is \"muddy\". A bit of humming static in the background as well while playing (not a lot, but noticeable if you have an ear for those things).That said, the build quality on those Cyber Acoustics is terrible. When they work, they sound incredible, but many of them (including mine) have bad wiring, so unless you're comfortable rewiring/soldering a new plug (the most common best fix for them), I'm not 100% sure you want those either. If you get a good copy though, they sound noticeably better than these Logitechs, for about the same price.I also have (and can strongly recommend) theCreative T30 Wireless Bluetooth 3.0, 2.0 Computer Speaker System with Near Field Communication, but they cost significantly more. They sound great though, even without a subwoofer.Finally, if you need something super portable, I've been super impressed with myAltec Lansing iM227 Orbit MP3 Speaker. For the price and size, it's the most amazing portable speaker I've tried. Much better sound and volume than other tiny speakers.One consideration: You can't use these Logitech speakers without having them plugged directly into the subwoofer. While the plug on the two main speakers will fit into the computer's audio port directly, they need the amplifier in the subwoofer to play at any significant volume. And I do wish the cables were a couple feet longer. They work on my desk setup, but it would be nice to be able to space them apart just a bit more. Wires on the Cyber Acoustics set above are noticeably longer and offer better configuration options.Anyway, there are a few other options to consider. Still, these aren't bad speakers, and are a decent choice for a desktop computer, or something similar. You could do a lot worse. Audiophiles will want something better though.",

		"reviewText" : "Sabrent provided a sample of this USB 3.0 card reader for evaluation, but unfortunately I can't recommend it very highly.  The reader has a short integral USB cord, and ports for compact flash (CF), SD, and micro SD cards.  Beneath a plastic a flip up cover, is a compartment with dedicated storage spaces for one CF, one SD, and one micro SD card.When you insert a micro SD card into the reader, it smoothly and securely clicks into place, and the chances of it accidentally falling out are remote.  For the SD card slot, the card slides in  about 0.4\", and there is no positive \"click\".  The card may not fall out, but I would feel more comfortable, if it went in a little deeper.Unfortunately, there are some significant issues with the CF card slot.  There are guides that are intended to slide into the slots on the sides of the CF cards, but they are too short and don't extend far enough to do a very good job.  It isn't that easy to slide a CF card into the reader, and have it mate smoothly with the 50 pins.  When the pins do not align properly with the holes in the CF card, damage can occur to the contact points.  If a pin is bent, you might be able to straighten it out, but if a pin is broken, replacement is probably your only option.After I inserted a couple of different CF cards, I took a look at the pins, and a couple of them were already out of alignment, and one was severely bent.  After just a few attempts, the reader was no longer useable.  This is pretty much a deal breaker, as I can't recommend any reader that might damage a card.Based on past experience, Sabrent usually does a better job of design than this.  Unfortunately, 2 out of 3 isn't a passing grade.  That may seem harsh, but if your high priced CF card is ruined, you may not be in a very forgiving mood.",

		"reviewText" : "I've been using these Bluetooth earbuds nearly every day for a month now, and I like them a lot. And while a month certainly isn't a great deal of time, so far they have worked well, and without issue.They come with three sets of different size rubber tips/pads, and two sets of different size \"fins\" to custom fit them to your ears. I chose to use the middle size rubber tips, and the large fins. For me, this arrangement held them in my ears very securely, even when doing quite a bit of physical activity. I also found them to be quite comfortable, even when I've had them in for three or four hours.Outdoor Tech claims the Bluetooth range is thirty-two feet, and that number is actually pretty accurate. However, they also claim the battery play/talk time is six hours, and I found that number to be a bit exaggerated. I'm getting much closer to five hours of use on a full charge.I haven't owned a lot of Bluetooth earbuds, but I have listened to quite a few pairs, and of the ones I've listened to and owned, these do sound the best. They sound terrific. Very nice highs, nice midrange, and good bass. They don't sound anywhere near as good as my over-ear Sennheiser HD 650s, and I didn't expect them to, but for on-the-go earbuds, they do sound excellent.As you likely know, these Bluetooth earbuds have a built-in in-line microphone, which gives you the ability to use them for phone calls. However, in my opinion, you should consider that nothing more than a nice bonus feature. The overall quality of that feature is lacking when compared to a traditional Bluetooth headset, and you should use a traditional Bluetooth headset if you're wanting something primarily for phone calls.These Bluetooth earbuds currently cost $100, and at that price I think they're definitely worth considering. There are certainly cheaper Bluetooth earbuds out there, but these earbuds sound terrific, work well, and so far they seem to be handling moisture/sweat much better than any other Bluetooth earbuds I've owned. Consequently, I do recommend these earbuds. Give them a try. I'm confident you'll be happy with them.If you have any questions about these earbuds, please feel free to ask, and I'll do my very best to answer. I hope you found this review helpful.",

		"reviewText" : "I wasn't sure what to expect with this because I have another laptop with similar specs but a different Intel processor and different brand and it seems to give me those high usage warnings frequently, especially when multi-tasking and/or watching videos and movies.  I am so pleased to say that I have had zero issues with this one so this processor and setup must do the trick.  It works like a dream! BTW, this is an Intel Pentium N3530 2.16 Ghz.  At the bottom of the page w/comparable specs, it shows an Intel Celeron.I haven't really had a huge desire for a tablet because I just thought I prefer the laptop style and I figured this would just be cumbersome, but I was wrong about this too.  This is a very small laptop but a large tablet and it is so easily mobile.  It's very lightweight and just flipping it all the way open and folding the keyboard back is so simple.  It makes it so portable and you just pull up the virtual keyboard on the screen and all works perfectly.  The screen adjusts to whether you are holding vertically or horizontally just as it does on a tablet.The display, sound and webcam are fantastic too.  I've had issues with sound recently on laptops so I'm so glad I hear well on this one.  With such a small laptop I wasn't sure but it works great and the screen resolution is pristine.  The whole computer feels quality even though lightweight.  When I pulled it out of the box and it was so compact and light I was a bit hesitant and unsure.  Give it just a little time. Once you get used to it I think you will be so pleasantly surprised.Finally, I will admit I've owned a few Dell laptops over the years and was less than impressed. However, I got a Dell desktop a few months back and it is fantastic and have had no issues with it.  And just since I've had this one, I like it more and more the longer I have it. So, I think they may have turned a corner on any issues they've had.  I know I have with any that I've had with them.  Great, quality products and enthusiastically recommend this computer, especially if you have to tote a laptop around frequently but don't want an open tablet as I didn't.UPDATE: I've had this computer for several weeks and have still had no error messages or high usage warnings.  I noticed that there was a 3 star review on here that said it is basic and the trackpad isn't responsive.  I want to say that my trackpad is very responsive. Because this is such a small laptop it may take some getting used to - pad itself is large.  Also, for this price point and with these specs, this computer performs amazingly well. I can watch movies or livestream while performing other tasks and have no problems at all.  No, it's not for heavy gamers, but I think most of them would not search for these specs and dimensions. I find myself taking this from room to room all throughout the day because it's so portable. Still enthusiastically 5 stars for me!I've had a couple of questions about the keyboard...it is pretty small because it is a small computer and, thus, a little harder to type on.  I definitely find it easier to type on the larger keyboards and miss that.  However, I would lose the easy portability if they made it any larger and I wouldn't want that.",

My ears are very small, those of my partner are huge. The buds fit both of us.One attractive extra for those who actually buy the item: since the company borrowed the product label from the cetaceans of the same name, for every unit sold it donates $1 to the nonprofit research, education and wildlife conservation Whaleman Foundation. Clearly that in itself is not reason to buy these ear buds, but it's something l'd have appreciated had I purchased the unit rather than obtaining my pair free from Amazon Vine.I like these ear buds very much and recommend them highly.",

		"reviewText" : "The Satechi Aluminum USB Wired Keypad is a great solution for those who have Apple computers and want a keypad to match it. The design is modeled off the sleek Apple Bluetooth wireless keyboard, and overall, it matches well. It is thin and light, and definitely portable, even though it is not wireless.The keys feel great to use, and definitely don&#8217;t feel cheap. There is also excellent tactile feedback, and I found I was able to use this just as easily as the number keypad on any full keyboard with one built in. The keys are white, and in my tests of using them with dirty hands (as one might often find doing), the dirt from my hands cleaned off the keys with just a simple slightly damp cloth. After cleaning off the keys, I didn&#8217;t notice any oily residue. With a few months to a year of usage, I&#8217;m sure the keys would show some wear, but that&#8217;s the case with any keyboard out there.This product is perfect for those looking to type out numbers a lot faster than with the number keys at the top of a standard keyboard. For example. someone using Excel or Numbers might find this will increase their productivity.The one issue I saw with the design of the wired keypad in their attempt to match the Apple bluetooth wireless keyboard is that this is thicker with a white bottom, whereas the Apple keyboard is thin at the portion which slants down. For those who care about this keypad matching the keyboard, this might be something to consider. If what I said was unclear, look at the stock pictures on the Amazon product page above to get a better idea of the white portion beneath the aluminum.Overall, I&#8217;m impressed by the design and functionality of the aluminum wired keypad by Satechi. It&#8217;s a great solution to those who have the Apple Bluetooth keyboard, or a MacBook, and want a keypad that will increase their productivity while looking right at home along with their Apple products. Apart from the white beneath the aluminum that detracted from matching the Apple keyboard, I couldn&#8217;t find any flaws with this product.I was provided with this item as a sample in exchange for my fair and honest evaluation.

		"reviewText" : "This mouse has a cord that is nearly 5 feet long so it's definitely not too short. It has sensitivity level of 1000 dpi which is perfectly good for average daily use but it may be a little lacking if you use it for serious gaming. 1000 dpi seems low compared to some of the higher sensitivity gaming mouses that I have used but it honestly still feels very responsive so I am not sure that it really matters much.I am using this mouse on my Dell laptop that is running Windows 8.1 and I have had no compatibility issues. I plugged it in and it was working within about 15 seconds. There are no CD's to run or software to install. It's truly plug and play.This mouse looks incredibly cool to say the least. It's oval shaped and almost like half of a big egg. Except it has a mirror finish on it that makes it look very futuristic. It sits nice in your hand and feels very natural. It doesn't have any other buttons on the top except for the left and right button and the scroll wheel on top. This mouse has LED lights inside that light up and illuminate the entire mouse. There are sections of the mouse that lights up bright and then there are sections where the light shines through the mirror finish. By default it will alternate colors but you can lock it on a certain color if you want. There is a button on the bottom that you flip and it will stay on it's current color. The same button will turn it off if you don't want to use the lights.This mouse doesn't have a lot of options but the LED lights and it's physical appearance is awesome. I can almost guarantee that anyone that walks in your house and sees this mouse will comment on how cool it is. It changes colors between various shades of blue, red, green and purple.I went back and forth when trying to decide whether or not this mouse deserves 4 or 5 stars. Again the sensitivity and options are a little lacking but this mouse is really fun to use and watch and I really enjoy using it. I have used a couple other illuminated mouses and they have also looked cool but this one looks even better. I decided that I like it enough to give it 5 stars.Sample provided for review.",

		"reviewText" : "I received my transmitted as a review sample from the manufacturer. I've owned four similar devices over the past five years, but this one is the slickest in looks and the easiest to install and use of them all. For one thing, the bluetooth part of this transmitter makes itself know as soon as you turn it on for the first time. You do not need to press any buttons or hold them down - just do a scan from your phone's bluetooth settings menu and 'mpow' shows up. Pair and connect, then find a free channel on you FM radio and match that channel with the FM transmitter on this device and you are set. Simple, fast and hassle free.What I love is the on-off button. In some older cars - particularly Porches - the lighter socket is always active. Some of the transmitters on the market do not have an on-off button and will drain your battery unless you remove it when you shut down your engine. So, for newer vehicles this may not seem important, but for older ones it's a major feature.The design is clever. The head attaches to the gooseneck via a magnetic connection that holds in place. The entire unit is compact.  However, the physical characteristics are not as important as the sound quality and here is where this one excels. Each incoming or outgoing call that I received or made with my Galaxy Note 3 phone was crystal clear on both ends. More importantly, when I am streaming music (a constant when I am driving) the device did not pick up any ignition interference. A few of my other transmitters would do that and it drove me nuts. This one seems to have zero EMI and RFI issues, for which I am grateful.Bottom line: if you have an older vehicle that is not bluetooth enabled, this is a quick and relatively inexpensive way to give it hand's free capability as well as the ability to stream music to your FM radio. As of the date of this review this particular model is the best one that I have owned and the one I sincerely recommend to friends.",

		"reviewText" : "If you are looking for value in terms of sound quality from desktop speakers versus cost, then the Logitech Z213 speakers deliver.  Over the years, I have tried speakers from several speaker companies for my computers and I have always returned to Logitech.  I use the speakers with my laptop as well as my iPod.  The sound quality of these speakers is very good, but not amazing.  However, you really cant expect more at this price.  The highs are not very bright and I would certainly say that the speakers tend to emphasis the low frequencies.  This is especially true with the option of producing a lot of bass from the subwoofer.  You can control the amount of bass using a knob on the subwoofer.  I rarely have the woofer turned up very far on a day to day basis because the subwoofer can really deliver to the point of being excessive.  But, the offer of a lot of bass is very nice if you are playing games or watching movies.The two speakers are small enough to sit on a desktop without claiming a lot of space.  The speakers are angled so that the drivers can be directed toward the ears of someone sitting at the desk.  I have the subwoofer sitting under the desk.  A cable runs from the port on my computer to the control pod which sits on my desktop and then to the speakers.  The control pod allows you to control the volume and to turn the speakers off without having to find the power switch on the subwoofer like some other models.  And a nice feature if you wear headphones at times is that there is a 3.5mm-compatible headphone jack on the control pod.  The port is convenient if you have a desktop which is under your desk.Overall, the Logitech Z213 multimedia speakers are good value for the cost.",

But a hub it is.Dimensions of the body are about 3 7/8 inches long by slightly over a half inch thick. It takes up very little space for road warriors and travelers, and if you are using a micro OTG connector for your phone or tablet like this one -Micro USB OTG Host Cable to USB 2.0 Adapter- this hib is the perfect way to expand it.I was concerned that this would not really support four devices simultaneously so I plugged it into my ThinkPad T61 running Windows XP. I populated the four ports with a mouse, a keyboard, my digital camera and my Galaxy Note 3 phone. I was especially eager to see if the phone balked because it's finicky about what gets plugged into it when it comes to synching and transferring. No problem with any of the devices (in fact I am writing this review using the external keyboard). I was able to read the camera's memory card with Windows Explorer while transferring a dummy file from my phone.  I did not test any of the claimed transfer speeds.Bottom line: this is small, convenient and works on my old laptop without a hitch. It may be only USB 2.0, but it's plenty fast for my needs. Especially since the only 3.0 device I own is my phone and I rarely connect it to anything but my 2.0 laptop. For what it is I rated it five stars.",

		"reviewText" : "The world is going wireless and Sabrent wants you to join the public without spending too much money in the process. This very product is very similar to the Duo Bluetooth Receiver by CoolStream and it's ironic that they both showed up in the same time frame. It's the Geek God showing me a sign of comparing them to see which one is better for you and I - the average consumer.The little gadget that I want to share with you guys and girls today is the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver (WF-RADU). There's a lot to talk about something so small and very affordable. Let's get started, shall we?What's in the Box?Sabrent is known for packing their products very well to ensure that it will arrive at your house safe and still in one piece. Other competitors should take note and step up their packing game due to the fact that the customer will judge a product first on it's impression. Anyways, you will receive the:- Sabrent Wi-Fi Audio Receiver (WF-RADU)- User Manual- Customer Support InformationThey didn't include a lot mainly because this little gadget works with hardly anything extra.Where Does the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver Exceed?Unlike it's competitor, CoolStream, this little gadget plays audio via your home Internet connection rather than Bluetooth. This means that more of your devices are able to play audio to a pair of wired speakers that can now become wireless with the simply addition of this little gadget by Sabrent.This means you can use your smartphone, tablet, Windows, and Mac computer mainly because the audio that is played to the little gadget is via AirPlay. Sabrent has even taken note that Apple has this pre-configured in their iDevices (i.e. iPod touch, iPhone, and iPad) as well as making sure that Android users has this benefit, too. On the other hand, Windows users are out of luck but that's a whole different story.Due to the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver playing music via the connection of Wi-Fi I have noticed that the signal was a lot stronger than Bluetooth. My Internet speed is pretty fast and the connection is solid no matter if I used a smartphone or a tablet.Where Does the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver Lack?AirPlay is known for playing multimedia from iOS devices and since the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver depends on this it kind of kick some people in the butt. Basically, those users, like myself, that own a Windows Phone won't have the luxury to use this little gadget like those that own an iDevice or/and Android device. I will continue to search for apps that use AirPlay for Windows Phone until then this isn't a recommended product for Windows Phone users.Besides the lacking support for Windows Phone users I also see a BIG difference from their main competitor, CoolStream, which is that there's no built-in battery. The Duo Bluetooth Receiver from CoolStream offers a built-in 8-hour battery while the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver requires you to plug it into a USB port (i.e. Computer, Wall Outlet, etc.).How the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver Fit in my Life?Personally, I don't see myself using this gadget mainly because the lack of support for Windows Phone as well as being required to plug it into a USB port just to power it. I do have the option to bring a portable battery charger but that's a bit much and I don't see myself having a big interest with it.I believe that this gadget fits better for a user that have a pair of speakers that are not in use but are near an outlet or/and computer and want them to use them again with the help of the Wi-Fi Audio Receiver. Basically, they will be able to control the audio in their home from anywhere inside and outside of their house.Why Should You Purchase this for Yourself?Do I recommend it? Well, yes and no; those that own an iOS and Android device should consider picking one up for themselves very soon but those that own a Windows Phone should wait until support is given either from Sabrent or an app in the Windows Store.",

		"reviewText" : "First of all, you have to love a company that uses an image of Bigfoot from the famous Patterson-Gimlin footage as their company logo - that is brilliant! Even better yet, they give you two stickers of their logo when you buy their products.This is my very first pair of wireless Bluetooth earbuds, and Outdoor Technologies Orcas Earbuds were very easy to pair with my iPhone. On my initial listen I found them to provide a very pleasant sound without much ear fatigue with extended listening.While the range of the ear buds seems great indoors while the iPhone is on the table, it tends to vary a little while moving about. It seemed to be necessary to put my iPhone in my right pants pocket while going on a walk (I usually keep it on the left), since it appears that the Bluetooth radio is on this side. The charging jack, LED, and multifunction switch are all on this side, so it would make sense that the radio would be there. If I put my iPhone in the left pocket, the signal tended to drop out often, so placement of the device is important. While moving about, the occasional split second drop out will always occur, but that is ok.The \"cans\" of the earbuds stick out a little bit that give them a little more weight than standard wired ones, so sometimes moving about will dislodge them from the ears a little more. A little twist puts them back in place, or, you can use the \"fins\" that Outdoor Technologies supplies to sort of \"lock\" the buds in place in your ear.  I found those to get a little bit uncomfortable after a while, so I tend not to use them. Joggers and runners may find it necessary to use the fins to keep the buds secure - but no pain no gain, right? Outdoor Technologies supplies 3 sizes of silicon tips and two sizes of fins to try and get the fit just right. Most people will wear the Orcas with the cord going behind their neck. Here's a warning for those with a fat neck, when sweaty, the cord gets stuck to your neck and it feels like the earbuds will come out of your ears if you turn your head. This is due to the silicon coating on the wire. I just want to proclaim that it is perfectly acceptable to wear the cord in the front, and I wear them that way most of the time. So, don't be embarrassed to wear them like that.The noise isolation on the Orcas is terrific. I mowed the lawn with these things and barely heard the lawnmower at all. The multifunctional switch allows the user to adjust the volume, pause, skip tracks, answer calls, and even call up Siri.The general sound is just the way I like headphones to be, deep clear bass, clear crisp highs with a well-defined breathy feel to them. While they may not meet the standards of audiophiles, the average listener will not be disappointed by the sound the Orcas put out. For some reason Outdoor Technologies does not provide the frequency response of the Orcas in their documentation or on their website. I'd be curious to see what it is.While I don't usually use a headset while talking on the phone, I tested out the earbuds and found the quality about average - A far cry from the music's sound quality. I even left myself a voicemail to hear how I would sound to other callers and found my voice a little garbled, but understandable. Maybe all headsets sound that way? I don't really know. I usually just use the handset.Overall, the Orcas are a nice product. They sound great, have a great battery life, and can be used for just about any activity without getting tangled up in wires. Oh, and you get a little carry bag with their logo screened on it to take on trips or just store them in.",

		"reviewText" : "The Blaster's latest was sent to me as a 'for review' unit. Of course, they never hinted that a positive review as expected in return.The point of the attached imperfect video (sorry, had to take off for our vacation so I could only afford one take) should, I hope, help those interested decide which of the leading 'big sound' portable speakers they'd prefer, the 'competition' beingBose SoundLink Bluetooth Speaker III. Speaking for myself, while both are 'good', I found the Blaster's sound a lot more organic, so to speak. It's louder and more powerful too even on this recording, made with its 'roar' enhancement off.I hope the first part of the video puts to rest the charge advanced by some professional reviewer that the Roar bass is weak. It's not. But I'm not going to say words. Just listen and decide.Now, for what the video's image and sound don't show and still in a Blaster vs. Bose comparison mode, the Roar is smaller and lighter which is a good thing given that its sound is fuller and louder. It also lays down flat vs. Bose's stand up operating mode so the Blaster is more stable. The Blaster seems to be selling for a better price at the time I'm writing this.It also comes with lots of features, and I'm sure I'm going to miss some of them:- Long battery life: should last for about 8 hours, according to specs.- Charges either off its proprietary solution or, slowly, off a computer through the USB port.- Bluetooth: of course. The video was playing off a Bluetooth pairing with a Chromebook playing Pandora. It supports various pairing modes, including one that would allow TWO phones.- Phone support, no surprise there, with most functions implemented through tapping one button.- NFC (Near Field Communication): if your phone has it, you can play stuff off your phone by simply placing it near the Blaster.- Voice recorder: yes, it does that. The built-in mic will capture your voice and record it to a MicroSD card.- MicroSD playback: allows random play (my favorite) or sequential with the ability to skip to the next song or folder/album- Panic alarm: don't know who will ever think of pushing the panic alarm button on the Blaster rather than screaming 'Help' in a panic situation but... well... it's there.- Charger mode: believe it or not, you can use the Blaster to charge your phone through a USB portLike I said, I suspect I might have missed a feature or 2 but, in the end, what really counts in an external speaker is sound quality, portability, ease of operation and price and on all of the above Blaster's Roar is outstanding.Oh, of course, I forgot to mention the Roar button. It's what you use if you want to expand the sound to 'fill the room'. It works and it does seem to spread the sound around.P.S. My review mentions an attached video. I am attaching one but my experience with Amazon is that it sometimes takes them a day or 2 to post the video part so, please check later if the video is not there when you are reading this.",

		"reviewText" : "I&#8217;m a big fan of the Brainwavz S1 (actually all of their headphones &#8211; have yet to be disappointed with any of their products). The S1 has been my main set for active use (e.g., workouts, runs, etc.) since the flat cable is very durable and resistant to tangles. The S5 keeps all the good features of the S1 and adds to it &#8211; the sound quality is richer and better defined.That&#8217;s not to say the S1 sounds poor &#8211; they are quite good, in fact. But the S5 are better. The highs are better defined and the midrange has more punch to it. The bass comes through clearly without moving into the harsh territory when the volume is pushed (as the S1s can do). The overall sound quality is very pleasing.The build quality seems solid &#8211; as solid as the S1 or better. I love the flat cable! I know that&#8217;s something that is not appreciated by everyone, but for me it&#8217;s been working out wonderfully. Although this (as most other Brainwavz headsets) comes with an excellent hard shell case, I usually tote my earbuds wrapped around my mp3 player in my pocket. Easy to carry; very stressful on the cables and can lead to tangles with round wires. Flat wires, especially those with a thick jacket such as these, survive that abuse with zero problems.The earbuds themselves are more sleekly shaped than the &#8220;can&#8221; style of the S1.Comfort is in line with the customary Brainwavz style, which is to say it&#8217;s outstanding. It comes with a wide range of tips to fit pretty much any ear, plus the Comply foam tips (which are my favorite). If fitted properly you end up with zero ear irritation plus excellent sound isolation and bass response.These are an over-the-ear design much like the S1. I never used that design prior to the S1 and it did take me a little time to get accustomed to it. It became second nature quickly, and the design is a lot more stable when exercising than the conventional in-ear design.These are more expensive than the S1, but you can hear the difference in price. Still, if you&#8217;re looking to keep the cost down a bit, the S1 is an excellent performer as well.Great sound, great comfort, wonderful cable design, and it comes with a solidly made case and lots of eartips. Highly recommend.[Sample provided for review]",

		"reviewText" : "USB 3.0 is the fastest method of transfer, capable of transferring 5GBps, but several computers don&#8217;t have sufficient ports to accommodate multiple USB 3.0 products, which is why it is important to purchase products like the Aukey USB 3.0 4-Port Compact Hub.&#9654; Package Contents&#8226; Aukey USB 3.0 4-Port Compact Hub&#8226; 24&#8221; USB 3.0 to USB 3.0 Cable&#9654; AccessoriesThe only accessory that this device includes is a 2&#8217; foot USB 3.0 to USB 3.0 cable, which is a very common cable used by hubs. The construction of the cable is thick, which ensures durability. I really like the choice of the male to male USB 3.0 cable, as this allows the user to never worry about which end of the cable is which, as it will always be the correct side.&#9654; Specifications&#8226; Product Model: Aukey M3H4&#8226; Product Name: Portable Super Speed 4 Ports USB 3.0 HUB&#8226; Output: 4x USB3.0 with maimum speeds of up to 5GBps&#8226; Dimension: 96*66*34mm (L x B x H)&#8226; Weight: 90g&#8226; Material: Aluminum&#8226; OS Supported: Windows XP/Vista/7/8/Linux & Mac (support USB)&#8226; Certified: CE, FCC&#8226; LED: Power and activity&#9654; HardwareThe device is small and light, allowing you to carry it in your pocket, if necessary. It comes in an aluminum casing at the top, where the USB ports are located, and squared off by a plastic white surface. I really like the aesthetics of this product, as the aluminum adds quality to a product which usually would be in plastic. On the top is a blue LED, which indicates the hub is on. This LED is very bright, bleeding into the first USB port on top, and the USB IN port on the left. Also on top is the Aukey name, logo, and four vertical USB ports along a white glossy surface. I like the choice of vertical ports, as it allows thicker USB products, such as flash drives, to be placed without obstructing other ports. On the bottom are two thick white rubber feet to avoid the product from slipping. I overall like the construction of the product, making it look sleek and functional, but the fact that this has no external power makes this unreliable for several high powered USB devices, such as hard drives.&#9654; Set upAll USB hubs are plug and play, which means that there should not be any required drivers. This means the only step to setting up this product is to connect this to your USB 3.0 port. USB 2.0/1.1 ports will suffice as well, but won&#8217;t reach the same transfer speeds.&#9654; TestingI tested this product with a benchmarking program called &#8220;CystalDiskMark&#8221; with mySilicon Power Rugged Armor A80. This program tells the speed of storage devices, whether internal or external. During my first test, I accompanied this drive with three other USB flash drives, and received unreliable results (100MB/s Read, 18MB/s Write) when my typical results are much higher (100MB/s Read and Write). For my next test, I used the Silicon Power A80 without any other used ports, and tested highly (111MB/s Read, 109MB/s Write). I received results of +11MB/s Read and +9MB/s Write from average results. As long as no other USB ports are used, these are above average results.&#9654; Final ThoughtsThis hub is made for users that don&#8217;t use several high powered USB 3.0 devices. As long as those conditions are met, this is definite an excellently constructed hub, performing 9MB/s above average write speeds. I recommend this product to anyone needing a non-powered USB hub, and give this a 5 star rating.Pros:+ Well crafted from aluminum, well lit, and performed well (9MB/s above average write speeds).+ Uses vertical ports, allowing much larger USB devices, such as flash drives, being used.Cons:- Doesn&#8217;t use external power, which means several high powered USBs cannot efficiently be used.I was provided a sample in exchange for a thorough and honest review.",

Don't get me wrong, this still will not rock the house but is much better than the average competition.  The M3 has nice design with a combination of gray and orange accent.  The shell is composed of a metal grill protecting the speaker, hard plastic backing and hard orange silicone band around the perimeter.The speaker is splash proof, not submersible but should be OK to use around the pool or around the bathroom.  Occasional splashes of water won't hurt the speaker performance.Like most Bluetooth speakers, press and hold the power button to turn on.  This will immediately start the pairing process if it is not paired already with an existing device. It can be recharged using a microUSB cable that plugs on the side.  There is a plug door which keeps the microUSB port, the aux in and reset button from getting wet.  It also came with a lanyard that connects to one corner, thereby you can hold it by the rope or hang it on your bag.Quick specs:- 1,000 mAH lithium battery- Charging time is about 3-4 hours- 100Hz-20Khz frequency response- 4 ohm, 3W speaker- Bluetooth V2.1+EDRA sample of this product was sent to me for review purposes.",

Both operating systems worked just as stated.  The first audio receiver would never keep the wifi on long enough to connect.  With a call to support, and lots of patience on their end as I worked through several troubleshooting efforts, a new receiver was on it's way.  The replacement worked perfectly the first time right out of the box.  I tried to use the receiver in numerous situations, with a variety of devices (old and new), and never had a moment of trouble.  The sound never lagged, dropped, or weakened.  I did find I lost the signal from the cellphone when a call came in, but I find that happens with some apps and not a real issue for me at all.  Being able to add wifi to technology I never thought could be connected has opened so many options to me.  I believe this product is even better sound quality than the Bluetooth speaker I used previously.  The Bluetooth would lag or weaken and that never happened with the Sabrent receiver.  I can comfortably give this 5 stars as the device works just as stated, and the support was excellent when the first device did not work.  Many times I've purchased something and gotten little or no support - but that is not the case with Sabrent!  Their friendly, knowledgeable and patient support staff willingly worked with me, and treated me with respect which many companies fail to do.

So the device emits a wifi network signal.  You connect your iPhone to that network and you can use Apple's AirPlay to transmit audio.  Great!  The only problem for me is that all my audio is streamed from the net.  Which I just had to disconnect from in order to connect to the wifi provided by the speaker.

		"reviewText" : "I have used a number of wireless solutions for extending range both indoors and outdoors.  These products included theLinksys Wireless Range Extender N600 Dual Band (RE2000)(indoors) and theTP-LINK TL-ANT2424B 2.4GHz 24dBi Directional Grid Parabolic Antenna, N Female connector, weather resistant(outdoors).  I found this product to be a good solution both indoors and outdoors. Of note, Blurex appears to be an up and coming manufacturer/distributor and I have been fairly impressed with most of their products so far (though its website leaves a lot to be desired and no online support is provided at this time).The product arrived packaged very well.  The build quality of the antenna is substantial.  The USB cable does not promote signal loss over its length.  Setup is generally easy and I experienced no issues. In my environment, I ran it from a Windows 7 computer (about 3 years old) to the outer edge of our back porch.  Windows 7 automtaically installed the drivers.  This placement extended the range throughout our entire backyard with very solid signal strength that was consistent. The mounting hardware was more than sufficient for my needs, though in some situations you may want/need to make minor adjustments.It is important to note that unlike traditional range extenders, this product, via USB, plugs directly into a computer and extends the wireless range of that device and any devices supported by that device. I can see this being a very useful product for over the road truck drivers who may access wi-fi at truck stops on the road and they need to lock in a more solid connection.  It will also be of significant benefit to those putting on events at hotels or convention centers in which you want to establish a solid connection.  Note- Sample provided fo review.",

		"reviewText" : "Disclosure: I received a free sample of this item to review by virtue of being a frequent Amazon reviewer. I rarely accept such invitations, but I did here because frankly, I wanted to know if this was a good bluetooth speaker. The verdict is: YES! The sound features crisp trebles and rich bass sound that comes together for a very pleasant listening experience. We rocked with this for several hours and still had 2 of 3 LEDs going, so the battery seems to be quite good, which is important since for me the whole point of a bluetooth speaker is portability.  My son has reported getting about 8 hours of service out of this speaker on one charge.  This is a terrific speaker for backyard barbecue parties and the like.This unit is beautifully made -- no one can fault the fit-and-finish here. You can play music directly from your computer through this speaker, from a MicroSD card (there is a slot for this) or do what I usually do and stream music from your iPhone or iPad. This little speaker does it all.For the price listed on Amazon this speaker is competitive for best of class. The sound is as good as my Bose Mini, and better than my Jambox. Creative is going to sell a zillion of these at these prices. RJB.",

		"reviewText" : "This mouse is really neat. I would never have thought that having a lighted mouse would be so cool but it sold me once the colors started rotating through. They are pleasing colors and if you have a favorite, you can lock that color in.It is a wired mouse but the cable is long enough to accommodate most desktop situations. I'm sure that it would be cool as a wire free device but imagine how quickly the batteries might have to be changed.The mouse itself is a super shiny chrome-type plastic. It is not metal but coated so it may eventually chip or rub off. Mine hasn't yet but it hasn't been used for a long time.The useability of the mouse is great. Great responsiveness, buttons are easy to reach with fingers gently resting in place, and there are nice finger rests for your thumb and ringfinger.The wheel is easy to turn and soft rubber.A cool gift for the person who has everything!I was provided a sample for testing and review.",

		"reviewText" : "The Sabrent 3-slot flash memory card reader is surprisingly compact at about 3 in. x 2 in. x 1/2 in., so it can function an all-in-one card reader solution for use at home or when travelling.  It will read SD, SDHC, Mini SD, Micro SD, and CF cards.It has not only a built-in USB 3.0 cable, but also storage for three different flash cards under a smoky translucent cover.  It is USB-powered, plug & play, and no drivers are needed, so it is simple and completely non-aggravating to use.  There is an LED indicator for power and activity.It ships in a plastic clamshell which does provide excellent protection, but frustration-free packaging would be an improvement.  Otherwise, I have no complaints about this fast and reliable flash card reader.A sample was provided for evaluation and review.",
